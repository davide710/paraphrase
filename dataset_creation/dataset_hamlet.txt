ORIGINAL	TRANSLATED
Who’s there?	Who is it?

Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.	No, answer me: Stop, and tell me who you are.

Long live the king!	May the king live a long time!

Bernardo?	Is that you, Bernardo?

He.	Him.

You come most carefully upon your hour.	You're very punctual.

’Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.	It's midnight now; go to bed, Francisco.

For this relief much thanks: ’tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.	Thank you for this break: it's freezing, and I'm heartbroken.

Have you had quiet guard?	Did you have a peaceful watch?

Not a mouse stirring.	Not even a mouse is moving.

Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.	Okay, good night. If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are joining me on guard duty, tell them to hurry up.

I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who’s there?	I think I hear someone. Stop! Who is it?

Friends to this ground.	Friends of this place.

And liegemen to the Dane.	Loyal subjects to the King of Denmark.

Give you good night.	Good night.

O, farewell, honest soldier: Who hath relieved you?	Goodbye, good soldier. Who replaced you on guard duty?

Bernardo has my place. Give you good night. (Exit.)	Bernardo is taking over my watch. Good night to you. (He leaves.)

Holla! Bernardo!	Hey! Bernardo!

Say, What, is Horatio there?	Tell me, is Horatio here?

A piece of him.	Part of him.

Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.	Welcome, Horatio; welcome, good Marcellus.

What, has this thing appear’d again to-night?	Has it shown up again tonight?

I have seen nothing.	I saw nothing.

Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	Horatio says it's just our imagination and refuses to believe what we saw, this terrifying ghost that we've seen twice. That's why I've asked him to join us tonight and keep watch, so if the ghost appears again, he can confirm what we've seen and talk to it.

Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.	Nonsense, nonsense, it won't show up.

Sit down awhile; And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen.	Sit down for a moment, and let us try again to tell you what we saw two nights ago, something you're clearly unwilling to believe.

Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	Okay, let's sit down and hear Bernardo talk about this.

Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one—	Just last night, when that same star west of the North Star had moved to shine on the part of the sky where it is now, Marcellus and I heard the bell strike one o'clock.

Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!	Quiet, stop talking; look, it's coming again!

In the same figure, like the king that’s dead.	Looking exactly like the dead king.

Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.	You're a scholar; talk to it, Horatio.

Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.	Doesn't it look like the king? Look at it, Horatio.

Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.	Most likely: it fills me with terror and amazement.

It would be spoke to.	It wants to be spoken to.

Question it, Horatio.	Ask him about it, Horatio.

What art thou that usurp’st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!	Who are you that steals this time of night, appearing in the impressive and battle-ready shape that the dead King of Denmark used to wear when he led his army? By God, I order you to speak!

It is offended.	Something is wrong.

See, it stalks away!	Look, it walks away!

Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak! (Exit Ghost.)	Stop! Talk, talk! I order you, speak!

’Tis gone, and will not answer.	It's gone and won't reply.

How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on’t?	Hey Horatio! You're shaking and look pale: Isn't this more than just imagination? What do you think about it?

Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.	I swear to God, I wouldn't have believed it without seeing it with my own eyes.

Is it not like the king?	Doesn't it look like the king?

As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. ’Tis strange.	Just as you look now, that's exactly the armor he wore when he fought ambitious Norway. He frowned like that once when, in an angry negotiation, he struck down the Polish soldiers on the ice. It's strange.

Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.	So, twice before, exactly at this dead of night, he has walked past our guard post with a soldier's stride.

In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen, but in my overall view, this suggests some kind of major crisis is coming for our country.

Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is’t that can inform me?	Please, someone who knows, sit down and tell me why this very disciplined and careful guard keeps working so hard every night, making the people of this country tired. And why are cannons being made every day, and war supplies bought from other countries? Why are shipbuilders being forced to work so hard, not even getting Sundays off? What could be happening that requires this hurried, exhausting work, making people work day and night? Who can tell me what's going on?

That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear’d to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet— For so this side of our known world esteem’d him— Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal’d compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return’d To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design’d, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other— As it doth well appear unto our state— But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	I can; at least, that’s what people are saying. Our former king, whose ghost we just saw, was killed by Fortinbras of Norway. Fortinbras, driven by excessive pride, challenged him to a fight. In that fight, our brave Hamlet—as everyone around here considered him—killed Fortinbras. Because of a legally binding agreement, Fortinbras forfeited all his lands to the winner when he died. Our king risked an equal amount of land; that land would have gone back to Fortinbras's family if Fortinbras had won. But, according to the agreement, Hamlet won it. Now, young Fortinbras, with his untested and fiery spirit, has gathered a bunch of reckless outlaws along the borders of Norway, hiring them for any dangerous job that comes along. It seems to us that his goal is to take back the lands his father lost by force. I believe this is the main reason for our military buildup, the reason we're keeping watch, and the cause of all this urgent activity in the country.

I think it be no other but e’en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch; so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.	I think it's exactly as you say. It makes perfect sense that this ominous figure, so like the king who died and is the reason for our conflicts, appears armed before the guards.

A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.— But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!	It's a tiny speck that bothers the mind. Just before mighty Julius Caesar fell in Rome's most glorious days, graves opened and the ghosts of the dead shrieked in the streets, like fiery comets, bloody rain, solar eclipses. Even the moon, which controls the ocean, was almost blacked out until the end of time. Similarly, terrible events are foreshadowed, like messengers before fate, or a preview to a coming doom, and heaven and earth together have shown these signs to us all. But wait, look! Here it comes again!

I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me: (Cock crows.) If thou art privy to thy country’s fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.	I'll go in front of it, even if it destroys me. Wait, ghost! If you can make any sound or speak, talk to me. If there's anything good I can do that would give you peace and give me favor, tell me. (Rooster crows.) If you know anything about what's going to happen to my country, which knowing it might prevent it, oh, tell me! Or if you hid stolen treasure in the ground while you were alive, which they say is why ghosts walk after death, tell me about it. Stay here and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

Shall I strike at it with my partisan?	Should I hit it with my spear?

Do, if it will not stand.	If it won't stay up, then let it fall.

’Tis here!	It's here!

’Tis here!	It's here!

’Tis gone! (Exit Ghost.) We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.	It’s gone! (The Ghost exits.) We're wrong to try to threaten something so majestic. It's invulnerable, like the air, and our angry hits are just a pointless joke.

It was about to speak, when the cock crew.	It was just about to talk, when the rooster crowed.

And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine: and of the truth herein This present object made probation.	Then it jumped like someone guilty when a scary order is given. I've heard the rooster, who is like the trumpet for morning, wakes up the sun god with his loud crow. And when the rooster crows, the wandering ghost goes back to where it belongs, whether that place is in the sea, fire, earth, or sky. And seeing this ghost disappear just now proves that story is true.

It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.	It disappeared when the rooster crowed. Some say that every year, around the time we celebrate the birth of Jesus, the rooster crows all night long. And then, they say, no ghost dares to wander; the nights are safe; then, the planets have no power, no fairy can cast a spell, and no witch can use her magic, the time is so holy and blessed.

So have I heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill: Break we our watch up; and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?	That's what I've heard, and I partly believe it. But look, it's morning, dressed in a reddish robe, walking across the dew on that high hill to the east. Let's end our watch; and I suggest we tell young Hamlet what we've seen tonight. I swear, this ghost that won't speak to us will speak to him. Do you agree we should tell him, since it's important to us, and it's our duty?

Let’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. (Exeunt.) 	Let’s do it, please; and I know where we can find him this morning in the most convenient place. (They exit.)

Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy— With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole— Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr’d Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail’d to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras— Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew’s purpose—to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	Although the memory of our dear brother Hamlet's death is still fresh, and it's right that we grieve deeply and our whole kingdom shares in our sorrow, reason has overcome our emotions enough that we mourn him wisely, while also remembering our own needs. Therefore, we have married our former sister-in-law, now our queen, who shares the throne of this powerful nation. We've done this with mixed feelings – with happiness mixed with sadness, with a wedding feeling like a funeral, balancing joy and grief equally. We took her as wife, and we didn’t ignore your good advice, which you freely gave in support of this decision. We thank you for that. Now, as you know, young Fortinbras, underestimating our strength, or believing that our kingdom is unstable because of our brother's recent death, and imagining he can take advantage of us, has been bothering us with demands to return the lands his father lost to our brave brother, according to the legal agreements. So, that's his situation. Now, turning to ourselves and this meeting: this is the matter: we have written to Norway, the uncle of young Fortinbras, who is old and bedridden and barely aware of his nephew's plans, asking him to stop Fortinbras's actions, since the soldiers, lists, and supplies are all being gathered from Norway's own people. And now, we send you, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, as messengers to old Norway, carrying this greeting. We are not giving you any more authority to deal with the king than what is written in these detailed instructions. Farewell, and let your speed show your dedication.

In that and all things will we show our duty.	We will show our loyalty in that and in everything.

We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. (Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.) And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is’t, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	We have no doubt. Goodbye. (Voltimand and Cornelius exit.) Now, Laertes, what’s your news? You mentioned a request; what is it, Laertes? You won't waste your breath speaking to the King of Denmark. What is it you want, Laertes, that I wouldn't offer you before you even ask? My relationship to your father is as natural as the head to the heart, as useful as the hand to the mouth. What do you want, Laertes?

My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.	My honored King, please allow me to return to France. Although I came to Denmark willingly to attend your coronation and show my respect, now that I've done my duty, my thoughts and desires are pulling me back to France. I humbly ask for your permission and forgiveness to leave.

Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?	Do you have your father's permission? What does Polonius say?

He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent: I do beseech you, give him leave to go.	My lord, he practically forced me to grant him permission to leave, begging and pleading until finally, against my better judgment, I agreed. I beg you, please let him go.

Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son—	Enjoy your time, Laertes; the time is yours, and use your best qualities as you wish! But now, my nephew Hamlet, and my son—

(Aside.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.	(To himself.) Too closely related, and not at all friendly.

How is it that the clouds still hang on you?	Why are you still so sad?

Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun.	No, my lord; I'm too hot.

Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.	Dear Hamlet, stop wearing your dark clothes, and look kindly on your king. Don’t always look down with sadness, searching for your dead father in the ground. You know death is normal; everything alive must die, going from life to eternity.

Ay, madam, it is common.	Yes, madam, death is normal.

If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?	If it is, why does it affect you so much?

Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not “seems.” ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected ’havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	Looks, madam! No, it is; I don't know "looks." It's not just my black clothes, dear mother, or the usual formal black outfits, or heavy sighs, or even the tears in my eyes, or my sad expression, along with all the ways people show grief, that truly show who I am. These things only appear to be, because they are actions someone could fake. But I have something inside that goes beyond what you see; these are just the clothes and decorations of sorrow.

’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool’d: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd; whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, “This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	Hamlet, it's good and natural that you mourn your father. But remember, everyone's father eventually dies. Their fathers died too, and they mourned for a while. But to grieve excessively is stubborn, sinful, and unmanly. It shows a lack of faith, a weak heart, an impatient mind, and a simple understanding. Death is a common thing, so why be so upset? It's a sin against heaven, the dead, and nature itself. Death happens to everyone. From the first death until today, it's always been this way. Please, put aside this useless grief, and think of me as your father. Everyone knows you are next in line to be king. And I love you as much as any father loves his son. As for your plan to return to school in Wittenberg, we don't want you to go. We ask you to stay here, where we can see you and be comforted by you. Stay here as our most important advisor, relative, and son.

Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.	Don't let your mother waste her pleas, Hamlet. I beg you, stay with us; don't go to Wittenberg.

I shall in all my best obey you, madam.	I will do my best to obey you, madam.

Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king’s rouse the heavens shall bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. (Exeunt all but Hamlet.)	Well, that's a kind and generous answer. Consider yourself as important as I am here in Denmark. Madam, come with me; Hamlet's willing and natural agreement makes me very happy. To celebrate this, every joyful toast in Denmark today will be announced by cannon fire that reaches the clouds, and the King's cheers will echo through the heavens like thunder on Earth. Come, let's go.

O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on’t! ah fie! ’tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month— Let me not think on’t—Frailty, thy name is woman!— A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow’d my poor father’s body, Like Niobe, all tears:—why she, even she— O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourn’d longer—married with my uncle, My father’s brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules: within a month: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not nor it cannot come to good: But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.	Oh, I wish my body would just melt away and turn into dew! Or that God hadn't made it a sin to kill yourself! God, God! How boring, rotten, and pointless everything in this world seems to me! Damn it! It's like an overgrown, weedy garden that's gone wild. Only disgusting, vulgar things grow here. That things should come to this! My father's only been dead two months, not even that long. He was such a great king, like a god compared to my uncle, a beast. He loved my mother so much he wouldn't even let the wind touch her face too hard. God, do I have to remember this? She used to cling to him, like her love for him only grew the more she showed it. And yet, within a month—I don't want to think about it—Weakness, that's what you are, woman!—In less than a month, before the shoes she wore to my father's funeral were even worn out, she remarried, like a weeping statue. God! Even an animal without reason would have mourned longer. She married my uncle, my father’s brother, who's as different from my father as I am from Hercules. Within a month! Before she'd even stopped crying over his death, she remarried. How horribly fast, rushing into a sinful marriage! This can't end well. But my heart is breaking; I have to stay silent.

Hail to your lordship!	Greetings, my lord!

I am glad to see you well: Horatio—or I do forget myself.	I'm happy you're doing well, Horatio—unless I've forgotten who I am.

The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.	The same, my lord, and always your loyal servant.

Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	Hey, my good friend; I'll call you that too. And what brings you here from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

My good lord—	My lord—

I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	I'm really happy to see you. Good evening, sir. But honestly, what brings you here from Wittenberg?

A truant disposition, good my lord.	I'm feeling like skipping school, my lord.

I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	I wouldn't want my enemy to say that about you, and I won't let you hurt my ears by making them believe your own accusations against yourself. I know you're not skipping duties. But what's your business in Elsinore? We'll show you how to really drink before you leave.

My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.	My lord, I came to attend your father's funeral.

I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.	Please, don't make fun of me, my friend; I think I was there to see my mother's wedding.

Indeed, my lord, it follow’d hard upon.	Yes, my lord, it happened very soon after.

Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father!—methinks I see my father.	Save, save, Horatio! The leftover food from the funeral was served as a cold meal at the wedding. I wish I had met my worst enemy in heaven before I ever saw that day, Horatio! My father!—I think I see my father.

Where, my lord?	Where, sir?

In my mind’s eye, Horatio.	In my imagination, Horatio.

I saw him once; he was a goodly king.	I saw him once; he was a handsome king.

He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.	He was a great man, all things considered. I won't see someone like him again.

My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	My lord, I think I saw him last night.

Saw? who?	Saw who?

My lord, the king your father.	My lord, your father, the king.

The king my father!	My father, the king!

Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.	Hold your surprise for a moment and listen closely, until I can tell you, with these men as witnesses, about this incredible thing that happened.

For God’s love, let me hear.	For God's sake, let me listen.

Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night, Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distill’d Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And I with them the third night kept the watch: Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes: I knew your father; These hands are not more like.	For two nights in a row, Marcellus and Bernardo, while on guard duty late at night, were met with this. A figure resembling your father, fully armed from head to toe, appeared before them and walked slowly and formally past them. Three times he walked within the length of his spear, right in front of their frightened eyes. They were so terrified they were practically paralyzed, and they stood silently without speaking to him. They told me all this in strict confidence, and I joined them on guard duty the third night. Just as they described, everything happened exactly as they said: the figure appeared at the right time, and every detail matched their account. I recognized your father; I am sure of it.

But where was this?	But where did this happen?

My lord, upon the platform where we watch’d.	My lord, on the platform where we were standing guard.

Did you not speak to it?	Didn't you talk to it?

My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish’d from our sight.	My lord, I did see it; but it didn't reply. I thought it once lifted its head and seemed about to move, as if it would speak. But right then, the rooster crowed loudly, and at the sound, it quickly disappeared, vanishing from our sight.

’Tis very strange.	That's really weird.

As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.	I swear it's true, my lord; we felt it was our duty to tell you about this.

Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night?	Yes, yes, gentlemen, but this worries me. Are you on guard duty tonight?

We do, my lord.	We will, my lord.

Arm’d, say you?	You say armed?

Arm’d, my lord.	Wearing armor, my lord.

From top to toe?	From head to foot?

My lord, from head to foot.	My lord, from top to bottom.

Then saw you not his face?	Didn't you see his face?

O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.	Yes, my lord; he had his helmet visor raised.

What, look’d he frowningly?	Did he look angry?

A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.	A face that looked more sad than angry.

Pale or red?	Are you pale or blushing?

Nay, very pale.	Yes, very pale.

And fix’d his eyes upon you?	And stared at you?

Most constantly.	Very faithfully.

I would I had been there.	I wish I had been there.

It would have much amazed you.	It would have greatly surprised you.

Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?	Yes, very similar, very similar. Did it stay long?

While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.	Someone could count to a hundred fairly quickly.

Longer, longer.	Keep going.

Not when I saw’t.	Not when I saw it.

His beard was grizzled—no?	Was his beard gray? Right?

It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver’d.	In his lifetime, it was like dark clothing edged with silver.

I will watch to-night; Perchance ’twill walk again.	I will stay awake tonight; maybe it will appear again.

I warrant it will.	I'm sure it will.

If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.	If it looks like my dead father, I'll speak to it, even if hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet. I beg you all, if you've kept this a secret until now, continue to keep it a secret. And whatever else happens tonight, understand it, but don't talk about it. I will repay your loyalty. Goodbye for now. I'll meet you on the platform between eleven and twelve.

Our duty to your honour.	We are at your service.

Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. (Exeunt all but Hamlet.) My father’s spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes. (Exit.)	Goodbye, with as much love as I have for you. (Everyone leaves except Hamlet.) My father's ghost in armor! Something's wrong; I suspect something dishonest. I wish it were night already! Until then, be patient, my soul: evil acts will be revealed, even if hidden. (Leaves.)

My necessaries are embark’d: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.	My things are already on the ship. Goodbye. And, sister, as soon as the winds are favorable and you can get someone to send a message, don't delay, but let me hear from you.

Do you doubt that?	Do you question that?

For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	As for Hamlet and his fleeting affection, consider it a passing trend, a youthful infatuation. Like a violet blooming briefly in springtime, it's eager but not lasting, sweet but temporary, a pleasant scent that lasts only a moment; nothing more.

No more but so?	Is that all?

Think it no more: For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will: but you must fear, His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster’d importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	Forget about him. A person's character develops along with their body. As he matures, his mind and soul expand as well. He might love you now, and his intentions might be pure. But you must remember that he is the prince, and his choices are not his alone. He is bound by his royal birth. Unlike ordinary people, he can't simply choose for himself because the well-being of the entire country depends on his decision. He must choose according to the will of the kingdom he leads. So, if he says he loves you, believe it only to the extent that his position allows him to act on his words, which is only as far as the country permits. Consider what you could lose if you believe his words too easily, give him your heart, or surrender your virginity to his uncontrolled desires. Be careful, Ophelia, be careful, my dear sister. Keep your feelings in check, away from the danger of desire. Even the most virtuous girl is too generous if she reveals her beauty openly. Even virtue is slandered. Problems often destroy young people before they even blossom. In the freshness of youth, diseases are most likely to spread. So be cautious. The safest course is to be fearful. Youth is rebellious by nature, even without outside influences.

I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whiles, like a puff’d and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede.	I will remember this good advice and guard it carefully. But, my dear brother, don't be like those bad priests who point out the difficult and painful path to heaven, while they themselves carelessly stroll down the easy road of pleasure, ignoring their own teachings.

O, fear me not. I stay too long: but here my father comes. (A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.)	Don't worry about me. I'm staying too long. But here comes my father. (Getting two blessings is twice as lucky; this is a good opportunity for a second goodbye.)

Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportion’d thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine ownself be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!	Now, Laertes, get on board, for goodness' sake! The wind is blowing favorably for your journey, and people are waiting for you. There, take my blessing with you! And remember these few pieces of advice: Don't always say what you're thinking, and don't act on every impulsive thought. Be friendly, but not too casual. Hold onto your proven friends tightly, but don't waste your time on every new acquaintance. Avoid getting into fights, but if you do, make sure your opponent regrets it. Listen to everyone, but speak to few. Hear everyone's opinions, but form your own conclusions. Dress as well as you can afford, but don't be flashy; be rich, not gaudy. Clothes often reveal the person, and in France, the upper class are particularly well-dressed and refined. Don't borrow or lend money; loans often ruin both the loan and the friendship, and borrowing makes you careless with your finances. Above all, be true to yourself, and then you can't be false to anyone. Farewell! May my blessing guide you!

Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	I humbly say goodbye, my lord.

The time invites you; go; your servants tend.	It's time to go; your servants are waiting.

Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you.	Goodbye, Ophelia, and remember carefully what I've told you.

’Tis in my memory lock’d, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	It's locked in my memory, and you alone will hold the key to it.

Farewell. (Exit.)	Goodbye. (He leaves.)

What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?	What did he say to you, Ophelia?

So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.	If you'd like, I have something to say about Prince Hamlet.

Marry, well bethought: ’Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so, as so ’tis put on me, And that in way of caution, I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth.	Oh, that’s a good point! I’ve been told that he’s been spending a lot of time with you privately recently, and you yourself have been very generous with your attention to him. If that’s true, as I’ve been told it is, and I’m saying this as a warning, then I must tell you, you’re not thinking clearly about what’s proper for my daughter and your reputation. What’s going on between you? Tell me the truth.

He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.	My lord, he has lately shown me a lot of affection.

Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?	Affection! Nonsense! You're talking like a naive young girl, inexperienced in such dangerous situations. Do you actually believe his offers of love?

I do not know, my lord, what I should think.	I don't know, sir, what to think.

Marry, I’ll teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.	Indeed, I'll explain it to you: consider yourself naive, believing these offers were genuine, when they're worthless. Value yourself more highly; or—not to wear out this tired expression by repeating it—you'll make me look like a fool.

My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.	My lord, he has earnestly pursued me with his love in a respectable way.

Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.	Yes, you can call it fashion; get on with it.

And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	And supported his words, my lord, with nearly every sacred promise imaginable.

Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to’t, I charge you: come your ways.	Yes, traps to catch foolish people. I know that when passion is strong, people make promises freely. These passionate displays, daughter, give more appearance than substance, and die out quickly, even as they're being made. Don't mistake them for real love. From now on, be less available; value your company more highly than a simple request for a meeting. As for Hamlet, remember he's young and has more freedom than you do. In short, Ophelia, don't believe his promises; they're not genuine, though they appear so. They're just used to get what they want, disguised as sacred vows to deceive you. That's all. I don't want you wasting any time, from this point forward, talking or meeting with Hamlet. Pay attention to this, I'm ordering you. Go now.

I shall obey, my lord. (Exeunt.)	I will do what you say, my lord. (They exit.)

The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.	The air is bitterly cold; it's very cold.

It is a nipping and an eager air.	It's a sharp and biting wind.

What hour now?	What time is it?

I think it lacks of twelve.	I think it's missing twelve.

No, it is struck.	No, it has happened.

Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. (A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within.) What does this mean, my lord?	Really? I didn't hear that. Then it's getting close to the time of year when the ghost usually appears. (Trumpets and cannons fire in the distance.) What does this firing mean, my lord?

The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.	The king is staying up tonight, partying hard, celebrating with drinking and wild, boisterous dancing. Every time he finishes his wine, the drums and trumpets loudly announce his toast.

Is it a custom?	Is that a tradition?

Ay, marry, is’t: But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour’d in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and tax’d of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform’d at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth—wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin— By the o’ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o’er-leavens The form of plausive manners, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star— Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo— Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault: the dram of eale Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.	Yes, it is. But in my opinion, even though I was born here and raised with these customs, it’s a tradition that's better broken than kept. This constant, excessive partying makes us criticized and judged by other countries. They call us drunks and insult our reputation with pig-like terms. It truly diminishes our accomplishments, even our greatest ones, taking away their value. Similarly, it often happens to individuals that because of some natural flaw in them – something they're born with, which they can't be blamed for, since no one chooses their birth – some imbalance in their personality often overwhelms their good sense and reason, or some habit overwhelms their otherwise pleasant behavior. These people, carrying the mark of one flaw, whether it's their nature or their fate—their other good qualities, no matter how pure or numerous—will be judged negatively because of that one fault. A small amount of evil can ruin a noble character, bringing it into disrepute.

Look, my lord, it comes!	My lord, look! It's coming!

Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee: I’ll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? (Ghost beckons Hamlet.)	May good angels protect us! Are you a good spirit or a damned goblin? Do you bring breezes from heaven or blasts from hell? Are your intentions evil or good? You come in such a mysterious form that I have to speak to you. I’ll call you Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: Oh, answer me! Don't let me remain ignorant, but tell me why your sacred bones, buried in death, have broken out of their burial cloths; why the tomb, where we saw you peacefully buried, has opened its heavy, marble jaws to throw you up again. What does this mean, that you, dead body, come again in full armor to visit the moonlight, making night terrifying; and why do we, mere mortals, so horribly shake our minds with thoughts beyond our understanding? Tell me, why is this? Why? What should we do?

It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	It's calling you to go with it, as if it has a secret it wants to tell only you.

Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it.	See how politely it's gesturing for you to move further away. But don't go with it.

No, by no means.	Absolutely not.

It will not speak; then I will follow it.	It won't talk; then I'll go after it.

Do not, my lord.	Please, don't, my lord.

Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life in a pin’s fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again: I’ll follow it.	Why should I be afraid? I don't value my life at all. And as for my soul, what can the ghost do to that, since it's immortal like the ghost itself? It's beckoning me again: I'll follow it.

What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o’er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it: The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.	What if it lures you to the water, my lord, or to the terrifying top of the cliff that juts out over the sea, and there takes on some other horrible shape, which might steal your ability to think clearly and drive you mad? Consider this: The place itself plants thoughts of suicide, even without a reason, into anyone's mind who looks down so many feet to the sea and hears it crashing below.

It waves me still. Go on; I’ll follow thee.	It's still waving at me. Go ahead; I'll follow you.

You shall not go, my lord.	You're not going, my lord.

Hold off your hands.	Stop! Don't touch him/it/me.

Be ruled; you shall not go.	Listen to me; you're not going.

My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve. Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me! I say, away! Go on; I’ll follow thee. (Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.)	My destiny is calling me, and it's making me as brave as a lion. I still have to go. Let go of me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll kill whoever stops me! I said, get out of the way! Go on; I'll follow you.

He waxes desperate with imagination.	His imagination is driving him crazy.

Let’s follow; ’tis not fit thus to obey him.	Let’s follow him; it’s not right to obey him like this.

Have after. To what issue will this come?	Let's follow them. What will be the result of this?

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	Something's wrong in Denmark.

Heaven will direct it.	God will guide it.

Nay, let’s follow him. (Exeunt.)	No, let's go after him. (They exit.)

Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I’ll go no further.	Where are you taking me? Tell me! I won't go any farther.

Mark me.	Listen to me.

I will.	I will.

My hour is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.	My time is almost here, when I must give myself over to the fires of hell.

Alas, poor ghost!	Oh, poor ghost!

Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.	Don't feel sorry for me, but listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you.

Speak; I am bound to hear.	Speak; I have to listen.

So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	You must take revenge when you hear this.

What?	What?

I am thy father’s spirit, Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love—	I am your father's ghost, destined to walk the night for a set time, and during the day, I'm trapped in fiery torment, until the terrible sins I committed while alive are burned away and forgiven. But I am not allowed to reveal the secrets of my prison. If I could, I would tell you a story so terrible that its mildest part would terrify you, freeze your blood, make your eyes pop out of your head, and make every hair on your head stand on end like the quills of an angry porcupine. But I cannot reveal these secrets to mortal ears. Listen, listen, oh, listen! If you ever loved your dear father—

O God!	Oh my God!

Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.	Avenge his horrible and unnatural murder.

Murder!	Murder!

Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange and unnatural.	Murder is horrible at its best, but this murder is especially horrible, strange, and against nature.

Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.	Tell me quickly, so I can rush to my revenge as fast as thought or love itself.

I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: ’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father’s life Now wears his crown.	I see you understand; You'd have to be more brain-dead than a useless weed growing by the river Lethe to not react to this. Now, Hamlet, listen: It's been said that while I was sleeping in my garden, a snake bit me. So, all of Denmark is completely deceived by a lie about my death. But know this, my son: The snake that killed your father now wears his crown.

O my prophetic soul! My uncle!	Oh, my soul knew it! My uncle!

Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts— O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen: O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark’d about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel’d, disappointed, unaneled, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire: Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. (Exit.)	Yes, that incestuous, adulterous animal, with his charming but treacherous gifts—oh, wicked charm and gifts, so seductive!—won over my seemingly virtuous queen to his shameful desires. Oh, Hamlet, what a terrible betrayal! She turned away from me, whose love was as strong as the marriage vows I made to her, and chose a worthless man whose talents were nothing compared to mine! But virtue, though tempted by evil disguised as goodness, will never be swayed. Similarly, lust, even if paired with a beautiful angel, will eventually grow tired of perfection and seek out filth. But wait! I think I smell the morning air; I must be brief. As I slept in my garden, as I always did in the afternoon, your uncle crept up on me during my unguarded moment, with poison in a vial. He poured the deadly liquid into my ears, and it spread through my body as quickly as mercury, turning my healthy blood into a curdled mess, like acid dropped into milk. That's what happened to me. A horrible rash instantly covered my body with a disgusting crust, like a leper's. So, while I slept, my own brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen, all at once. I was killed in the middle of my sins, without last rites, unprepared, and unforgiven, sent to face judgment with all my sins unforgiven. Oh, horrible! Oh, horrible! Most horrible! If you have any humanity in you, don't let it go unpunished. Don't let the royal bed of Denmark be a place for lust and incest. But whatever you do, don't let this poison your mind or let your soul plot against your mother. Leave her to heaven and the guilt that torments her. Farewell, farewell! The glow-worm shows that morning is near and its light is fading. Goodbye, goodbye! Hamlet, remember me.

O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix’d with baser matter: yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables—meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark: (Writing.) So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is “Adieu, adieu! remember me.” I have sworn’t.	Oh, you heavenly powers! Oh, earth! What else is there? Should I include hell? No, never! Calm down, my heart; and you, my muscles, don't suddenly weaken, but keep me standing strong. Remember you! Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I can remember anything in this confused head. Remember you! Yes, from the tablet of my memory, I'll erase all silly, unimportant memories, all sayings from books, all shapes and impressions from the past, that youth and experience have recorded there; and your command alone will live in the book and pages of my brain, unmixed with anything trivial. Yes, by heaven! Oh, most evil woman! Oh, villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My notepad—it's fitting I write this down: that someone can smile and smile and be a villain. At least I’m sure it can be that way in Denmark. (Writing.) So, uncle, there you are. Now to my promise: It is “Goodbye, goodbye! Remember me.” I have sworn it.

(Within.) My lord, my lord—	My lord, my lord!

(Within.) Lord Hamlet—	Hey, Hamlet!

(Within.) Heaven secure him!	(From inside.) May God protect him!

So be it!	So be it.

(Within.) Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!	(From inside.) Hey, hello there, my lord!

Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.	Hey there, boy! Come here, come here.

How is’t, my noble lord?	How are you, my lord?

What news, my lord?	What's new, my lord?

O, wonderful!	Wow!

Good my lord, tell it.	Please, my lord, tell it.

No; you’ll reveal it.	No, you'll tell it.

Not I, my lord, by heaven.	I didn't, my lord, I swear.

Nor I, my lord.	Neither do I, my lord.

How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you’ll be secret?	What do you think about that? Would anyone believe it? But you'll keep it a secret, right?

There’s ne’er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.	There isn't a single bad guy in all of Denmark who isn't a total scoundrel.

There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.	You don't need a ghost to come from the grave to tell us that.

Why, right; you are i’ the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business and desire shall point you; For every man has business and desire, Such as it is; and for mine own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.	Yes, you're right, you're absolutely right. So, without any further delay, I think it's best we shake hands and go our separate ways. You go wherever your work and wishes lead you. Everyone has work and desires of some kind. As for me, well, I'm going to go pray.

These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.	My lord, these are just crazy and rambling words.

I’m sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, ’faith heartily.	I'm truly sorry if they upset you; yes, really truly sorry.

There’s no offence, my lord.	No offense, my lord.

Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, O’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request.	Yes, I swear by Saint Patrick, there is something wrong, Horatio, very wrong. About this ghost we saw, I believe it's a truthful ghost, I'm telling you. As for your curiosity about what happened between us, try to control it as best you can. And now, my good friends, since you are friends, educated, and brave soldiers, grant me a small favor.

What is’t, my lord? we will.	What is it, my lord? We will.

Never make known what you have seen to-night.	Don't tell anyone what you saw tonight.

MARCELLUS: My lord, we will not.	We will not, my lord.

Nay, but swear’t.	No, really, swear it.

In faith, My lord, not I.	Honestly, my lord, not me.

Nor I, my lord, in faith.	Honestly, my lord, neither do I.

Upon my sword.	On my sword.

We have sworn, my lord, already.	We have already sworn, my lord.

Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.	Yes, I swear it.

(Beneath.) Swear.	(From under the stage.) Promise you'll do it.

Ah, ha, boy! say’st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come on—you hear this fellow in the cellarage— Consent to swear.	Aha, boy! You really think so? Are you there, good friend? Come on—you hear this guy in the basement— Agree to swear.

Propose the oath, my lord.	Ask them to swear, my lord.

Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword.	Swear by my sword to never speak of what you've seen.

(Beneath.) Swear.	Swear it.

Hic et ubique? then we’ll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Never to speak of this that you have heard, Swear by my sword.	Here and everywhere? Then we'll move somewhere else. Come here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again: Swear by my sword never to talk about what you've heard.

(Beneath.) Swear.	Swear.

Well said, old mole! canst work i’ the earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.	Good job, old mole! Can you dig in the ground that quickly? A skilled pioneer! Let's move it again, good friends.

O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!	Wow, this is incredibly strange!

And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe’er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber’d thus, or this headshake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As “Well, well, we know,” or “We could, an if we would,” Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be, an if they might,” Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.	So, treat it like something new. Horatio, there are more things in the world than you can imagine. But come on. Swear to me that no matter how strange I act from now on, you will never cross your arms, shake your head, or say things like "We know," "We could if we wanted to," "If we felt like talking," or "They would if they could," or any other vague comment, to suggest you know anything about me. Swear you won’t do this, so that you will receive help when you need it most.

(Beneath.) Swear.	Swear.

Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! (They swear.) So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let’s go together. (Exeunt.)	Be at peace, restless ghost! (They swear.) So, gentlemen, with all my love, I entrust myself to you. Anything a man as insignificant as I am can do to show my love and friendship, I will, God willing. Let’s go inside together; and please, keep your fingers on your lips. The world is out of order: Oh, what a terrible fate, that I was ever born to fix it! No, come on, let’s go together. (They exit.)

Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.	Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.

I will, my lord.	I will, sir.

You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.	You'd be very smart, good Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior before you go see him.

My lord, I did intend it.	My lord, that was my intention.

Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it: Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, “I know his father and his friends, And in part him:” do you mark this, Reynaldo?	Indeed, well spoken; very well spoken. Listen, sir, first find out what Danes are in Paris; how they are doing, who they are, what money they have, and where they live, what company they keep, and how much it costs them. If you discover through this roundabout and careful questioning that they know my son, approach the subject more indirectly than directly asking about him. Pretend you have some slight acquaintance with him, like saying, "I know his father and his friends, and I know him a little." Do you understand this, Reynaldo?

Ay, very well, my lord.	Yes, very well, my lord.

“And in part him; but” you may say “not well: But, if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild; Addicted so-and-so:” and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty.	Say that you know him somewhat, but not well. But if it's the man I mean, he's very reckless and has these habits: Then, add whatever lies you want, but nothing so awful that it ruins his reputation. Be careful about that. But, sir, mention the kind of careless, wild, and common mistakes that are typical of young men enjoying their freedom.

As gaming, my lord.	Like gambling, my lord.

Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing: you may go so far.	Yes, or drinking, fighting, cursing, arguing, whoring: you can go that far.

My lord, that would dishonour him.	My lord, that would shame him.

’Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.	No, really; be careful how you accuse him. Don't add another accusation that he's sexually loose. That's not what I mean. But describe his faults so cleverly that they seem like the result of freedom, the impulsive actions of a passionate person, a wildness in untamed youth that everyone experiences.

But, my good lord—	But, sir—

Wherefore should you do this?	Why would you do this?

Ay, my lord, I would know that.	Yes, my lord, I want to know that.

Marry, sir, here’s my drift; And, I believe, it is a fetch of wit: You laying these slight sullies on my son, As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured He closes with you in this consequence; “Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,” According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country.	Indeed, sir, here’s what I'm getting at; and I think it’s quite clever: You are putting these small stains on my son, as if he’s slightly flawed, understand? You want to gauge his friends in conversation, those you would test. If they have ever seen my son commit these alleged crimes you’re talking about, be sure he'll agree with you; saying "Good sir," or something like that, or "friend," or "gentleman," depending on how they usually address someone of that rank and from that country.

Very good, my lord.	Okay, my lord.

And then, sir, does he this—he does—what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something: where did I leave?	And then, sir, he does this—he does—what was I going to say? Honestly, I was about to say something: where was I?

At “closes in the consequence,” at “friend or so,” and “gentleman.”	When he thinks about the results, about a friend or two, and about being a gentleman.

At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry; He closes thus: “I know the gentleman; I saw him yesterday, or t’ other day, Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, There was a’ gaming; there o’ertook in’s rouse; There falling out at tennis:” or perchance, “I saw him enter such a house of sale,” Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?	Yes, it "adds up," definitely. He says things like: "I know the guy; I saw him yesterday, or the day before, or sometime around then; with these people; and like you said, there was gambling; he got drunk; they argued at tennis:" or maybe, "I saw him go into a house of, let's say, a brothel, or something similar." See? Your little lie catches this big truth. And that's how we clever and insightful people, with roundabout methods and calculated risks, find things out indirectly. So, follow my previous instruction and advice, and you will too, my son. Do you understand me?

My lord, I have.	Yes, my lord.

God be wi’ you; fare you well.	Goodbye, and take care.

Good my lord!	My good lord!

Observe his inclination in yourself.	Figure out what he likes by watching yourself.

I shall, my lord.	I will, my lord.

And let him ply his music.	Let him play his music.

Well, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

Farewell! (Exit Reynaldo.)	Goodbye! (Reynaldo leaves.)

How now, Ophelia! what’s the matter?	Hey, Ophelia! What's wrong?

O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!	Oh, my lord, my lord, I have been so frightened!

With what, i’ the name of God?	What in God's name?

My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his stockings foul’d, Ungarter’d, and down-gyved to his ankle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors—he comes before me.	My lord, I was sewing in my room when Lord Hamlet appeared. His jacket was open, he wasn't wearing a hat, his stockings were dirty, and had fallen down around his ankles. He was as pale as his shirt, his knees were knocking together, and he looked so miserable, as if he'd just escaped from hell to tell me about terrible things. He came before me.

Mad for thy love?	Crazy because of my love for you?

My lord, I do not know; But truly, I do fear it.	My lord, I don't know, but I'm really afraid so.

What said he?	What did he say?

He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being: that done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turn’d, He seem’d to find his way without his eyes; For out o’ doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me.	He grabbed my wrist and held it tightly. Then he stepped back as far as his arm could reach. With his other hand over his forehead, he stared at my face as if he were trying to memorize it. He stayed like that for a long time. Finally, after shaking my arm slightly and shaking his head up and down three times, he let out such a deep and sorrowful sigh that it seemed to shake his whole body and almost kill him. After doing that, he let me go. Then, with his head turned over his shoulder, he seemed to be finding his way without looking, because he went out the door without using his eyes and, until the very end, kept his gaze fixed on me.

Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late?	Come, go with me. I'll go find the king. This is definitely madness caused by love, which destroys itself with its own intensity, and drives people to desperate actions as often as any strong emotion does. I'm sorry to see this. Have you been harsh with him recently?

No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.	No, my lord, as you ordered, I refused to accept his letters and would not allow him to see me.

That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him: I fear’d he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. (Exeunt.) 	That has driven him crazy. I regret that I didn't pay closer attention to him and understand him better. I thought he was just fooling around and intended to harm you, but damn my suspicion! By heaven, it's as typical of people our age to overestimate our own judgment as it is common for young people to lack good sense. Come, let's go to the king. He must know about this; keeping it a secret could cause more pain than speaking about our love.

Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s transformation; so call it, Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighbour’d to his youth and havior, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time: so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, That, open’d, lies within our remedy.	Welcome, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Besides that we wanted to see you, our need for your help made us send for you so quickly. You've probably heard about Hamlet's change; we'll call it that, since he doesn't seem like himself, inside or out. I can't imagine what, other than his father's death, could have made him so unlike himself. I ask you both, since you grew up with him and know him so well, to stay here at court for a while. Try to get him to enjoy himself through your company, and find out anything you can about what might be bothering him that we don't know. If we know what it is, maybe we can fix it.

Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king’s remembrance.	Good sirs, he has spoken of you often; and I'm certain there aren't two men alive he's closer to. If you would be so kind as to spend some time with us, to help us with what we hope to achieve, your visit will be rewarded with thanks a king would remember.

Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.	Your Majesties could, by the authority you have over us, order us to do what you want rather than just asking.

But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.	We both agree to obey, and we fully intend to offer our services freely to you, to be commanded.

Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.	Thank you, Rosencrantz and dear Guildenstern.

Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.	Thank you, Guildenstern and good Rosencrantz. Please go right away and visit my son, who is very much changed. Some of you, go and take these gentlemen to where Hamlet is.

Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!	May God make our being here and what we do a comfort and help to him!

Ay, amen! (Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants.)	Yes, amen! (Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some servants exit.)

The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return’d.	The messengers from Norway, sir, have happily returned.

Thou still hast been the father of good news.	You've always brought good news.

Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king: And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.	Have I? I assure you, my good king, I am as loyal as I am to my own soul, both to God and to you. And I think, unless my mind is failing me, I have figured out the real reason for Hamlet's madness.

O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.	Oh, tell me about that; that's what I'm eager to hear.

Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	Let the ambassadors in first; my news will be the dessert after that main course.

Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. (Exit Polonius.) He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.	Do the polite thing and bring them in. (Polonius exits.) He tells me, my dear Gertrude, that he has found the cause and origin of your son’s madness.

I doubt it is no other but the main; His father’s death, and our o’erhasty marriage.	I'm sure it's for no other reason than the obvious ones: his father's death and our too-quick marriage.

Well, we shall sift him.	Okay, we'll investigate him.

Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?	Hello, my good friends! Tell me, Voltimand, what news from our brother, the King of Norway?

Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew’s levies; which to him appear’d To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack; But, better look’d into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, (Giving a paper.) That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.	He returned our greetings and requests very kindly. Initially, he sent troops to stop his nephew's army, which he thought was preparing for war against Poland. But after investigating more closely, he realized it was actually aimed at you, your Majesty. Upset that his illness, age, and weakness were being exploited, he ordered Fortinbras's arrest. Fortinbras quickly obeyed, was scolded by the King of Norway, and finally swore to his uncle never to attack you again. Overjoyed, the old King of Norway gave Fortinbras three thousand crowns a year and permission to use the same soldiers he had gathered earlier against Poland, with a request (handing over a document) that you would allow them safe passage through your lands for this campaign, under the conditions of safety and agreement written here.

It likes us well; And at our more consider’d time well read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour: Go to your rest; at night we’ll feast together: Most welcome home! (Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.)	This pleases us. When we've had more time to carefully read and consider it, we'll respond and make a decision about this matter. In the meantime, we thank you for your well-executed efforts. Go get some rest; tonight we'll celebrate together. Welcome home!

This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is’t but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.	This matter is finished well. Your Majesty, and Madam, to explain what royalty should be, what loyalty is, why day is day, night is night, and time is time, would only waste night, day, and time. Therefore, since being brief is the essence of intelligence, and being long-winded is just extra and unnecessary, I will be brief: your son is mad. I call it madness because, to define real madness, what is it other than simply being mad? But never mind that.

More matter, with less art.	Get to the point.

Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity; And pity ’tis ’tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. (Reads.) “To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most beautified Ophelia,”—	Madam, I swear I'm not using any trickery. It's true he's mad, it's true, and it's a shame; and it's a shame it's true – a silly way of speaking, but forget it, I won't use any trickery. Let's agree he's mad, then. Now we need to find the cause of this, or rather, the reason for this problem, because this flawed result has a cause. That's the situation, and the solution is this. Consider this carefully. I have a daughter—for now, she is mine—who, being dutiful and obedient, listen, has given me this. Now consider and guess. (Reads.) "To the heavenly and adored Ophelia,"—

That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “beautified” is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: (Reads.) “In her excellent white bosom, these, etc.”	That's a bad choice of words, a disgusting choice of words; "beautified" is a disgusting word. But listen to this. Like this: (Reads.) "On her wonderfully white chest, this..."

Came this from Hamlet to her?	Did this come from Hamlet to her?

Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. (Reads.) “Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love.	Please wait a moment, madam. I will be true to my word. (Reads.) "Question whether the stars are fire; Question whether the sun moves; Question whether truth is a lie; But never question my love."

“O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. “Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet.”	"Oh, dear Ophelia, I'm bad at expressing myself in verse. I can't even count all my sighs of sorrow. But believe me, I love you more than anything, more than anything in the world. Goodbye. Yours forever, my dearest lady, as long as I live, Hamlet."

This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means and place, All given to mine ear.	My daughter showed me this out of obedience. Furthermore, she told me about his attempts to win her over, describing how they happened over time, through different methods, and in various locations – she told me everything.

But how hath she Received his love?	But how did she react to his love?

What do you think of me?	What do you think of me?

As of a man faithful and honourable.	Like someone loyal and respectable.

I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing— As I perceived it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me—what might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If I had play’d the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look’d upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:” and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulsed—a short tale to make— Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for.	I'd like to be proven right. But what would you have thought if, after I saw this passionate love taking flight—and I noticed it, I must tell you, before my daughter did—what would you, or my dear queen, your wife, have thought if I had acted like an unfeeling object, ignored my feelings, or simply watched this love idly? What would you have thought? No, I took immediate action and said to my young daughter, "Lord Hamlet is a prince beyond your reach; this cannot be." And then I instructed her to isolate herself from him, refuse any messengers, and accept no gifts. After she did this, she followed my advice; and Hamlet, rejected—to cut a long story short—fell into sadness, then stopped eating, then stayed awake all night, then became weak, then delirious, and, through this decline, into the madness he now suffers from, which we are all grieving.

Do you think ’tis this?	Do you think it's this?

It may be, very likely.	That's possible, very likely.

Hath there been such a time—I’d fain know that— That I have positively said “ ’Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?	Has there ever been a time—I really want to know—that I have definitely said, "It is so," when it turned out to be wrong?

Not that I know.	As far as I know, no.

(Pointing to his head and shoulder.) Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.	If I'm wrong, take my head from my shoulders. If the situation guides me, I will find the truth, even if it's hidden at the earth's core.

How may we try it further?	How else can we test it?

You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.	You know, sometimes he walks back and forth in the lobby for four hours straight.

So he does indeed.	Yes, that's true.

At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him: Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall’n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.	I'll let my daughter meet with him then. You and I will hide behind a curtain and watch them. If he doesn't love her, and his madness isn't caused by her, then I'm not fit to advise the king, and I should just go back to farming.

We will try it.	We'll give it a shot.

But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.	But look, here comes that miserable fellow, reading sadly.

Away, I do beseech you, both away: I’ll board him presently. (Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.)	Please, both of you, leave now! I'll go talk to him right away. (King, Queen, and Attendants exit.)

O, give me leave: How does my good Lord Hamlet?	Please, tell me: How is my good Lord Hamlet doing?

Well, God-a-mercy.	Well, God have mercy.

Do you know me, my lord?	Do you recognize me, sir?

Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.	Okay, fine; you're a fish seller.

Not I, my lord.	No, sir.

Then I would you were so honest a man.	I wish you were that honest.

Honest, my lord!	Truly, my lord!

Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.	Yes, sir; in today's world, being honest is being one in ten thousand.

That’s very true, my lord.	That's very true, sir.

For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion—Have you a daughter?	Because if the sun can create maggots in a dead dog—even though it's like a god touching rotting flesh—do you have a daughter?

I have, my lord.	Yes, sir.

Let her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to’t.	Don't let her go out in the sun. Having children is a blessing, but not if your daughter has one. Friend, take care of this.

(Aside.) How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?	(To himself.) What do you think of that? He keeps obsessing about my daughter. Yet he didn't recognize me at first; he called me a fish seller. He's really lost it, completely gone. And honestly, when I was young, I suffered a lot for love, almost as much as he is. I'll talk to him again. What are you reading, my lord?

Words, words, words.	Just words, words, words.

What is the matter, my lord?	What's wrong, my lord?

Between who?	Between whom?

I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.	I'm talking about what you're reading, sir.

Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.	Insults, sir. This sarcastic guy writes here that old men have grey beards, wrinkled faces, eyes that drip thick yellow and dark goo, and that they're basically clueless and have really weak legs. I totally believe this is true, but I don't think it's right to write it down like this, because you yourself will be as old as me eventually... unless you can age backwards like a crab.

(Aside.) Though this be madness, yet there is method in’t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?	(To himself.) Even though he seems crazy, there's a reason for what he's doing. Would you like to step out of the cold air, my lord?

Into my grave.	To my death.

Indeed, that is out o’ the air. (Aside.) How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.—My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.	That's beside the point. (To himself.) How full of meaning his answers are sometimes! It's lucky madness can achieve insights that reason and sanity couldn't produce so well. I'll leave him now and quickly arrange a meeting between him and my daughter. My lord, I'll take my leave.

You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life.	Sir, you can't take anything from me that I wouldn't gladly give up, except my life, except my life, except my life.

Fare you well, my lord.	Goodbye, my lord.

These tedious old fools!	These boring old idiots!

You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.	You're looking for Prince Hamlet; he's over there.

(To Polonius.) God save you, sir! (Exit Polonius.)	(To Polonius.) Good day to you, sir! (Exit Polonius.)

My honoured lord!	My lord!

My most dear lord!	My dearest lord!

My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?	My very good friends! How are you, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good fellows, how are you both doing?

As the indifferent children of the earth.	Like ordinary people.

Happy, in that we are not over-happy; On fortune’s cap we are not the very button.	We're lucky because we're not too lucky; we're not at the very top of the wheel of fortune.

Nor the soles of her shoe?	Not even the bottoms of her shoes?

Neither, my lord.	No, sir.

Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?	So, you're always around her, or always trying to get on her good side?

’Faith, her privates we.	Indeed, we are her close friends.

In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What’s the news?	In the hidden workings of luck? Oh, that's so right; luck is a whore. What's new?

None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.	No, my lord, just that everyone's become honest.

Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?	Then the end of the world must be close, but your news can't be true. Let me ask more specifically: what have you, my good friends, done to deserve such bad luck that it lands you in prison here?

Prison, my lord!	Yes, my lord, a prison!

Denmark’s a prison.	Denmark is a prison.

Then is the world one.	Then everything is in agreement.

A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o’ the worst.	A nice one, really; full of borders, prisons, and cells. And Denmark is one of the worst.

We think not so, my lord.	We don't think so, sir.

Why, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.	Well, then it isn't anything to you. Nothing is really good or bad; we just think it is. But to me, it feels like a prison.

Why then, your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for your mind.	Well then, your ambition makes it a prison; it's too small for your mind.

O God, I could be bounded in a nut-shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.	Oh God, I could be happy in a tiny space and feel like I rule the world, if I didn't have nightmares.

Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.	These dreams are really ambition itself, because what ambitious people are made of is just the shadow of a dream.

A dream itself is but a shadow.	A dream is just a shadow.

Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.	Honestly, I think ambition is so insubstantial and fleeting that it's just a shadow of a shadow.

Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.	Then our beggars are real, and our kings and fallen heroes are just shadows of beggars. Shall we go to the court? Because, honestly, I can't think straight.

We’ll wait upon you.	We will wait for you.

We’ll wait upon you.	We'll wait for you.

No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?	That's not the case. I won't put you in the same category as my other servants, because, to be honest, I have a terrible entourage. But, as a friend, what are you doing in Elsinore?

To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.	Just to see you, my lord; for no other reason.

Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.	Even though I'm a beggar, I can't even find the words to thank you properly, but I do thank you. And honestly, dear friends, my thanks aren't worth even a tiny amount. Were you asked to come here? Or did you come on your own? Is this a voluntary visit? Please, be honest with me. Come on, tell me the truth.

What should we say, my lord?	What should we say, sir?

Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.	Anything but the truth. You were summoned. And there's a guilty look on your faces that you're not clever enough to hide. I know the king and queen sent for you.

To what end, my lord?	For what purpose, my lord?

That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?	You'll have to tell me. But I beg you, by the bonds of our friendship, by the closeness of our age, by the promise of our lasting love, and by whatever stronger reason someone could use to persuade you, be honest and straightforward with me: were you summoned here, or not?

(Aside to Guildenstern.) What say you?	(Speaking quietly to Guildenstern.) What do you think?

(Aside.) Nay, then, I have an eye of you.—If you love me, hold not off.	(To himself.) Alright, I'm watching you. If you care about me, don't hold back.

My lord, we were sent for.	My lord, we were summoned.

I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.	I'll tell you why. I'll tell you before you figure it out yourself, and your silence toward the king and queen will remain completely intact. Lately, and I don't know why, I've lost all my joy. I've stopped doing my usual exercises. And honestly, I feel so down that the beautiful world, the Earth, seems like a barren wasteland. The sky, this amazing roof above us, decorated with shining stars, looks to me like nothing more than a disgusting cloud of disease. What an amazing creation is man! How intelligent! How limitless in ability! How graceful and wonderful in movement! How angelic in action! How godlike in understanding! The beauty of the world! The perfect being! And yet, to me, what is this perfect being made of dust? Man doesn't make me happy. And neither does woman, even though your smile seems to suggest otherwise.

My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.	My lord, I wasn't thinking anything like that.

Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?	Why did you laugh then, when I said I find no pleasure in people?

To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.	My lord, if you don't enjoy people, consider how poorly you'll treat the actors. We passed them on the road; they're coming here to perform for you.

He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o’ the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for’t. What players are they?	The actor playing the king will be treated well; his highness will get gifts from me. The daring knight will use his sword and shield; the lover won't sigh for nothing; the eccentric man will finish his role calmly; the comedian will make those laugh whose lungs are easily amused; and the lady will speak her mind freely, or the play's rhythm will suffer. What kind of actors are they?

Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.	Even the actors you used to enjoy, the city's best.

How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.	How is it they're touring? Staying here, where they were known and making good money, was better for them in every way.

I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.	I think their reluctance comes from the new change.

Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? are they so followed?	Do they still have the same reputation they had when I was in town? Are they still so popular?

No, indeed, are they not.	No, they really aren't.

How comes it? do they grow rusty?	What's wrong? Are they getting rusty?

Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.	No, their acting is still as slow and boring as usual. But there’s this new thing, sir: a group of child actors, little baby hawks, who scream at the top of their lungs, and get wild applause for it. These kids are all the rage now, and they attack the regular theaters – that's what they're called – so fiercely that lots of gentlemen with swords are scared of playwrights' pens and barely even go there anymore.

What, are they children? who maintains ’em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?	What, are they kids? Who's paying for them? How are they being taken care of? Will they only act as long as they can sing well? Won't they later say, if they end up as regular actors—which is likely if they don't have more money—that their playwrights are unfair to make them speak out against their own future?

’Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.	Honestly, there was a lot of action on both sides; and the people don't think it's wrong to egg them on to fight. For a while, no one would pay to watch a debate unless the poet and actor were actually punching each other over the issue.

Is’t possible?	Is that possible?

O, there has been much throwing about of brains.	Oh, there's been a lot of thinking going on.

Do the boys carry it away?	Are the actors taking the body away?

Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.	Yes, they do, my lord; Hercules and all his weight as well.

It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. ’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. (Flourish of trumpets within.)	It's not that surprising; my uncle is the king of Denmark, and the people who used to make faces at him when my father was alive now pay twenty, forty, fifty, even a hundred ducats each for a tiny portrait of him. God, there's something unnatural about this, if philosophy could only figure it out. (Trumpets sound inside.)

There are the players.	The actors are here.

Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.	Welcome to Elsinore, gentlemen. Give me your hands. Welcoming you properly requires polite customs and formalities. Let me do this right, so my attention to the actors (which, I must say, needs to be obviously welcoming) doesn't seem like I'm treating them better than I'm treating you. You're welcome, but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are mistaken.

In what, my dear lord?	About what, my dear lord?

I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.	I'm only crazy sometimes, like when the wind is blowing from the north-northwest. At other times, when the wind is from the south, I can tell the difference between obvious things.

Well be with you, gentlemen!	Goodbye, gentlemen!

Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.	Listen, Guildenstern, and you as well: since you're both listening. That big infant you see over there hasn't grown up yet.

Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.	Luckily, he's returned to them this second time, because people say an old man is like a child again.

I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir: o’ Monday morning; ’twas so indeed.	I bet he's coming to tell me about the actors; pay attention. You're right, sir: it was Monday morning; that's exactly when it happened.

My lord, I have news to tell you.	My lord, I have news for you.

My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome—	My lord, I have news for you. Back when Roscius was an actor in Rome—

The actors are come hither, my lord.	The actors have arrived, my lord.

Buz, buz!	Hush, hush!

Upon mine honour—	I swear it.

Then came each actor on his ass—	Then the actors arrived.

The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.	The best actors in the world can perform any kind of play: tragedy, comedy, history, or anything in between. Seneca wouldn't be too serious for them, and Plautus wouldn't be too silly. They are the only actors who truly understand the rules and freedom of acting.

O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!	Oh, Jephthah, the judge of Israel, what a valuable thing you had!

What a treasure had he, my lord?	What was he worth, my lord?

Why, “One fair daughter and no more, The which he loved passing well.”	Well, "One beautiful daughter and no other, whom he loved very much."

(Aside.) Still on my daughter.	(To himself.) Still thinking about my daughter.

Am I not i’ the right, old Jephthah?	Am I not correct, like old Jephthah?

If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.	If you're comparing me to Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter whom I love very much.

Nay, that follows not.	No, that doesn't necessarily follow.

What follows, then, my lord?	So, what happens next, sir?

Why, “As by lot, God wot,”	Well, "By chance, God knows."

and then, you know, “It came to pass, as most like it was,”—	And then, you know, "It happened, as it probably did."

the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes.	The first verse of the religious song will tell you more; and look, here comes my short version of things.

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! thy face is valanced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: we’ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech.	Welcome, gentlemen; welcome, everyone. I'm happy to see you all well. Welcome, good friends. Oh, my old friend! You have a beard now since I last saw you: have you come to challenge me here in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By Our Lady, you're taller than when I last saw you, raised up by those platform shoes. I hope your voice, like a bad coin, isn't flawed. Gentlemen, you are all welcome. Let’s get right to it like eager falconers, attack anything we see: we’ll have a speech right away: come on, show us what you're capable of; come on, give us a passionate speech.

What speech, my lord?	What are you talking about?

I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; ’twas caviare to the general: but it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved: ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see— “The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,”—	I remember you reciting a speech once, but it was never performed, or if it was, only once. I recall the play wasn't popular; it was too sophisticated for the average person. But I, and others whose opinions I value, thought it was excellent, well-structured, and written with both restraint and skill. I remember someone said the writing wasn't trying to be flashy or overly clever, but was straightforward, healthy, sweet, and more elegant than showy. There was one speech I particularly loved: Aeneas's story to Dido, especially the part about the killing of Priam. If you remember it, start with this line: Let me see... "The violent Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian tiger..."

—it is not so:—it begins with Pyrrhus:— “The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d With heraldry more dismal; head to foot Now is he total gules; horridly trick’d With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Baked and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their lord’s murder: roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks.”	That's not right. It starts with Pyrrhus: "Fierce Pyrrhus, whose dark armor, as black as his intentions, looked like the night when he hid inside the fateful horse, has now stained this frightening, dark appearance with even more horrifying signs. He is covered head to toe in red, terribly decorated with the blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, and sons, baked and glued on by the scorching streets that provide a cruel and evil light for their king's murder. Burning with rage and fire, and covered completely in clotted blood, with eyes like glowing coals, the hellish Pyrrhus looks for old grandfather Priam."

So, proceed you.	Go ahead.

’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.	By God, my lord, well said, with good pronunciation and good judgment.

“Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command: unequal match’d, Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear: for, lo! his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick: So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus’ pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall On Mars’s armour forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, In general synod take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends!”	Soon he finds him swinging and missing the Greeks; his old sword, disobedient to his hand, falls to the ground, refusing to be controlled. Overmatched, Pyrrhus attacks Priam; in fury, he swings wildly; but with just the breeze and wind of his deadly sword, the weakened old man falls. Then senseless Troy, as if feeling this blow, with its burning peak, collapses to the ground with a horrible crash that fills Pyrrhus' ears. For, look! his sword, which was about to fall on the white-haired head of respected Priam, seemed to stop in the air. So, like a tyrant in a painting, Pyrrhus stood, and like someone who doesn't care, did nothing. But, just as we often see before a storm, a silence in the sky, the clouds stand still, the strong winds are silent and the world below is as quiet as death, soon the terrible thunder rips through the sky, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, awakened revenge makes him start again; and the Cyclops' hammers never fell on Mars' armor, forged to be eternally strong, with less mercy than Pyrrhus' bloody sword now falls on Priam. Damn you, Fortune! All you gods, in a general meeting, take away her power; break all the spokes and rims from her wheel, and roll the round hub down the hill of heaven, as low as to the devils!

This is too long.	This is too long.

It shall to the barber’s, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he’s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.	Your beard needs a shave. Please, continue. He wants a dance, a dirty story, or he’ll fall asleep. Keep going, get to Hecuba.

“But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen—”	But who, oh who, had seen the muffled queen—

“The mobled queen?”	The muffled queen?

That’s good; “mobled queen” is good.	That's good; "muffled queen" is good.

“Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o’er-teemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep’d, ’Gainst Fortune’s state would treason have pronounced: But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband’s limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made, Unless things mortal move them not at all, Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods.”	Running barefoot back and forth, tears blinding her; a rag on her head where a crown recently sat; and instead of a robe, a blanket wrapped around her thin and worn-out body, grabbed in a moment of fear. Anyone who saw this would have bitterly cursed Fortune's cruelty. But if even the gods had seen her then, when she saw Pyrrhus brutally hacking her husband to pieces, the immediate scream she let out would have brought tears to the eyes of the heavens and moved the gods to pity – unless mortal suffering means nothing to them.

Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in’s eyes. Pray you, no more.	See if he hasn't gone pale and has tears in his eyes. Please, stop now.

’Tis well; I’ll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.	Okay, good. I'll have you finish the story later. My lord, please make sure the actors are comfortable. Listen, treat them well, because they are a short and lively record of our times. After you die, you're better off having a bad headstone than having them speak ill of you while you're alive.

My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	My lord, I will treat them as they deserve.

God’s bodykins, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who should ’scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.	Good lord, man, much better. If you treat everyone as they deserve, who would avoid being punished? Treat them according to your own sense of honor and status. The less they deserve, the more virtuous you are for being generous. Take them in.

Come, sirs.	Let's go, guys.

Follow him, friends: we’ll hear a play to-morrow. (Exit Polonius with all the Players but the First.) Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago?	Go after him, everyone. We’ll see a play tomorrow. (Polonius leaves with all the actors except the lead one.) Listen, my friend; can you perform “The Murder of Gonzago?"

Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

We’ll ha’t to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in’t, could you not?	We'll have it performed tomorrow night. You could, if necessary, learn a speech of about twelve or sixteen lines, which I would write out and put in, couldn't you?

Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

And can you, by no drift of circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?	Can't you figure out, from anything that's happened, why he's acting so strangely, disrupting his peaceful life with this wild and dangerous madness?

He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause he will by no means speak.	He admits he feels disturbed, but he absolutely refuses to say why.

Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.	We can't get him to open up, but with a sly craziness, he stays distant when we try to get him to admit how he really feels.

Did he receive you well?	Did he treat you kindly?

Most like a gentleman.	Looks like a real gentleman.

But with much forcing of his disposition.	But by really forcing himself to act that way.

Niggard of question; but, of our demands, Most free in his reply.	He didn't ask many questions, but he answered ours very openly.

Did you assay him To any pastime?	Did you try to get him to do anything fun?

Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o’er-raught on the way: of these we told him; And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it: they are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.	Madam, it happened that we ran into some actors on the road. We told him about them, and he seemed happy to hear it. They're at the castle now, and I think they've already been asked to perform for him tonight.

’Tis most true: And he beseech’d me to entreat your majesties To hear and see the matter.	That's completely true. And he asked me to request your majesties to listen to and watch the performance.

With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.	With all my heart, and it makes me very happy to hear he feels that way. Good gentlemen, encourage him even more, and push him to enjoy these pleasures.

We shall, my lord. (Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.)	We will, my lord. (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.)

Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as ’twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia: Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behaved, If’t be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for.	Dear Gertrude, please leave us as well. We have secretly sent for Hamlet to come here so that he might run into Ophelia, seemingly by chance. Her father and I, as legal spies, will hide ourselves in such a way that we can see without being seen, freely observe their meeting, and understand from his behavior whether it is love sickness or something else that is making him suffer like this.

I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.	I will do as you say. And as for you, Ophelia, I hope that your beauty is the reason for Hamlet's madness. Then, I can hope that your good qualities will bring him back to his normal self, for the good of both of you.

Madam, I wish it may. (Exit Queen.)	I hope so, ma'am.

Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves. (To Ophelia.) Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this— ’Tis too much proved—that with devotion’s visage And pious action we do sugar o’er The devil himself.	Ophelia, walk around here. If you would be so kind, we will step aside. (To Ophelia.) Read this book; pretending to be occupied might explain why you're alone. We are often guilty of this—it's been proven too many times—that we use a religious appearance and holy actions to disguise the devil himself.

(Aside.) O, ’tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: O heavy burthen!	(To himself.) Oh, it's so true! How much that comment hurts my conscience! A prostitute's face, made beautiful with makeup, isn't more disgusting to the thing that covers it than my actions are to my deceptive words. Oh, what a heavy burden!

I hear him coming: let’s withdraw, my lord. (Exeunt King and Polonius.)	I hear him coming. Let’s leave, my lord. (The King and Polonius exit.)

(To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover’d country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.—Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember’d.)	To live, or not to live: that is the question: Is it better to put up with all the bad things that happen to us, or to fight against all our troubles and end them by dying? To die: to sleep; nothing more; and in that sleep, to know that we are ending the heartache and all the pain that everyone experiences. That's an end worth wanting. To die, to sleep; to sleep: maybe to dream. Ah, but there's the problem. Because in death, what dreams might come after we've escaped this life, that's what makes us hesitate. That's the reason we suffer for so long. Otherwise, who would put up with all the insults and unfair treatment, the arrogance of powerful people, the pain of being rejected in love, the delays of the legal system, the rudeness of officials, and the way good people are treated badly by those who don't deserve it, when they could simply end it all with a knife? Who would want to carry all the burdens of life, sweating and grumbling, if it weren't for the fear of what might happen after death? That unknown place that no one ever comes back from makes us uncertain and makes us prefer to suffer the problems we know, rather than risk new ones we don't know about. So, fear of the unknown makes us all cowards. And, that's why even our strongest desires become weak and pale with too much thinking, and great plans get changed and never acted on. But quiet, here comes the beautiful Ophelia! Remember me in your prayers, my sweet lady, for all the wrong things I've done.

Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?	My lord, how have you been for quite some time?

I humbly thank you; well, well, well.	I sincerely thank you; okay, okay, okay.

My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them.	My lord, I have things of yours that I've been wanting to return for a long time. Please, take them now.

No, not I; I never gave you aught.	No, not me; I never gave you anything.

My honour’d lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.	My lord, you know very well that you did; and along with them, you spoke such lovely words that made the gifts even more valuable. Now that their sweet scent is gone, please take them back; because to a noble person, expensive gifts become worthless when the giver is unkind. There you are, my lord.

Ha, ha! are you honest?	Seriously, are you truthful?

My lord?	My lord?

Are you fair?	Are you beautiful?

What means your lordship?	What do you mean, sir?

That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.	If you are truly honest and beautiful, your honesty should not allow your beauty to tempt you to do wrong.

Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?	My lord, could beauty find a better partner than honesty?

Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.	Yes, that's true; because beauty is more likely to corrupt honesty than honesty can make beauty honest. This used to seem like a contradiction, but now it's been proven true. I did love you, once.

Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.	Yes, my lord, you convinced me of that.

You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.	You shouldn't have believed me; goodness can't change our basic nature enough to completely get rid of our old ways: I didn't love you.

I was the more deceived.	I was even more wrong.

Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where’s your father?	Go to a convent: why would you bring more sinners into the world? I’m reasonably honest myself, but even I could accuse myself of things so bad it would have been better if my mother hadn’t given birth to me. I'm very proud, vengeful, ambitious, and have more sins waiting to be committed than I can even think of, imagine, or find the time to do. What should people like me be doing, crawling between heaven and earth? We’re all complete scoundrels; don't trust any of us. Go to a convent. Where is your father?

At home, my lord.	At my place, sir.

Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in’s own house. Farewell.	Lock him inside, so he can only be a fool at home. Goodbye.

O, help him, you sweet heavens!	Oh, you kind heavens, please help him!

If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.	If you get married, I curse you with this as your wedding gift: even if you are as pure as ice and snow, you will not avoid being slandered. Go to a convent, goodbye. Or, if you really must marry, marry a fool, because smart men know what kind of monsters you turn them into. Go to a convent, and quickly. Goodbye.

O heavenly powers, restore him!	Oh, God, bring him back to his senses!

I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God’s creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. (Exit.)	I know all about your makeup, alright. God gave you one face, and you create another. You dance, you walk affectedly, you lisp, you give people nicknames, and you use your foolishness as an excuse for your behavior. Enough! I can't take it anymore; it's driving me crazy. I'm telling you, we're not going to have any more marriages. Those who are already married, everyone but one, will live. The rest will stay single. Go to a convent.

O, what a noble mind is here o’erthrown! The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck’d the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch’d form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!	Oh, what a great mind is ruined! He was the ideal courtier, soldier, and scholar—everything you could want in those roles. He was the hope and beauty of our wonderful country, the trendsetter and the model of good manners, admired by everyone. And now he's completely broken. I, the most miserable and unhappy of women, who once believed his sweet promises of love, now see that his brilliant and powerful mind is like beautiful bells ringing discordantly, sounding awful. That perfect figure and face of blossoming youth is destroyed by madness. Oh, how sad I am to have seen what I have seen and to see what I see now!

Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack’d form a little, Was not like madness. There’s something in his soul, O’er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger: which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on’t?	Love isn't the reason for his behavior. And even though his words were a bit disorganized, he doesn't seem crazy. Something is troubling him deeply, and I suspect the result could be dangerous. To prevent that, I've quickly decided he must be sent to England to collect the tribute we're owed. Perhaps the change of scenery will drive whatever is bothering him out of his head and make him act like himself again. What do you think?

It shall do well: but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief: let her be round with him; And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.	That should work out. Still, I think the reason for his sadness comes from being rejected in love. Ophelia, what’s going on? You don't have to tell us what Hamlet said; we heard everything. My lord, do what you want. But, if you think it's a good idea, after the play, let his mother talk to him alone and ask him to explain why he's so sad. Let her be direct with him, and I’ll be hidden nearby to listen to everything they say. If she can't figure out what's wrong, send him to England, or lock him up wherever you think is best.

It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch’d go. (Exeunt.) 	It must be this way: We can't ignore madness in important people. (They exit.)

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.	Say the speech, please, exactly as I taught it to you, smoothly and naturally. If you over-enunciate it, like many actors do, I’d rather have the town crier deliver my lines. And don’t wave your hands around too much, but use them calmly. Even in the most intense and passionate moments, you need to find a balance that makes it flow. It disgusts me to hear some loud, wig-wearing actor shout and rip a speech to shreds, just to please the uneducated audience members who only understand simple, silent shows and loud noises. I'd have that kind of actor punished for overacting like a violent tyrant; it's worse than any villain. Please, avoid that.

I warrant your honour.	I assure you, sir.

Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature’s journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	Don't be too passive, but let your own good sense guide you. Make your actions fit your words, and your words fit your actions. Above all, don't go beyond what is natural. Anything exaggerated misses the point of acting, which is, and always has been, to hold up a mirror to nature, to show goodness what it truly looks like, evil its true reflection, and to reveal the spirit and essence of our time. Exaggeration, or anything done poorly, might make the inexperienced laugh, but it will definitely upset those with good taste. Their judgment should matter more to you than the applause of a whole theater of others. I've seen actors on stage, praised by others to the skies – and I don't say this to be disrespectful – who have neither the voice nor the bearing of a human being, Christian or otherwise. They strut and shout so badly that I think they must have been made by some apprentice of nature who didn't do a very good job, because their imitation of humanity is just awful.

I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.	I hope we've improved that somewhat, sir.

O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. (Exeunt Players.)	Just fix it completely. And tell those playing the funny parts to stick to the script; because some of them will laugh at their own jokes to get the clueless audience members to laugh too, even when the play is dealing with something important. That's terrible, and it shows a really pathetic desire for attention from the idiot doing it. Go get ready.

And the queen too, and that presently.	And the queen, right away.

Bid the players make haste. (Exit Polonius.) Will you two help to hasten them?	Tell the actors to hurry. (Polonius leaves.) Will you two help get them moving faster?

We will, my lord. (Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.)	We will, my lord.

What ho! Horatio!	Hey! Horatio!

Here, sweet lord, at your service.	Here I am, my lord, ready to help you.

Horatio, thou art e’en as just a man As e’er my conversation coped withal.	Horatio, you are as fair a man as I have ever met.

O, my dear lord—	Oh, my dear love.

Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter’d? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal’d thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta’en with equal thanks: and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion’s slave, and I will wear him In my heart’s core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.—Something too much of this.— There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father’s death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming.	No, don't think I'm flattering you. What could I possibly gain from you? You have no income, only your good nature, to feed and clothe you. Why would anyone flatter a poor man? No, let flattering words be used for ridiculous displays of wealth and power, where people bend over backwards to gain something. Do you understand? Ever since I was old enough to choose for myself and tell people apart, I chose you. You've always been someone who, while experiencing everything, seems to suffer nothing, a man who accepts good and bad fortune with equal gratitude. And blessed are those who have their emotions and reason so well balanced that they aren't easily manipulated by fortune. Give me that man who isn't controlled by his emotions, and I will cherish him deeply, as I do you. Enough of this. There's a play tonight for the king. One scene is very similar to the way I told you my father died. Please, when you see that scene being acted out, observe my uncle with all your attention. If his hidden guilt doesn't reveal itself in a single word, then the ghost we saw was a demon, and my suspicions are completely wrong. Pay close attention to him, because I'll be watching his face intensely. Afterwards, we'll compare our observations and decide what we think of his behavior.

Well, my lord: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And ’scape detecting, I will pay the theft.	Okay, my lord: If he steals anything while this play is happening and gets away with it, I'll pay for what was stolen.

They are coming to the play; I must be idle: Get you a place.	They're coming to the play; I need to act naturally. Go find a seat.

How fares our cousin Hamlet?	How is our cousin Hamlet doing?

Excellent, i’ faith; of the chameleon’s dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.	Great, honestly! Like a chameleon's meal: I live on promises alone. You can't fatten chickens with that.

I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.	I have nothing to do with this response, Hamlet; these are not my words.

No, nor mine now. (To Polonius.) My lord, you played once i’ the university, you say?	No, not anymore. (To Polonius.) My lord, you said you acted once at the university?

That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.	I did, my lord, and was considered a good actor.

What did you enact?	What play did you perform?

I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i’ the Capitol; Brutus killed me.	I played Julius Caesar; I was killed in the Capitol building; Brutus killed me.

It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?	It was cruel of him to kill such a fine calf. Are the actors ready?

Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.	Yes, my lord; they are waiting for you to be ready.

Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.	Come here, my dear Hamlet, sit next to me.

No, good mother, here’s metal more attractive.	No, mother, I find something here more appealing.

(To the King.) O, ho! do you mark that?	Hey! Did you see that?

Lady, shall I lie in your lap? (Lying down at Ophelia’s feet.)	May I put my head in your lap?

No, my lord.	No, sir.

I mean, my head upon your lap?	Do you mind if I rest my head on your lap?

Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

Do you think I meant country matters?	Do you think I was talking about sex?

I think nothing, my lord.	I'm thinking about nothing, my lord.

That’s a fair thought to lie between maids’ legs.	That's a dirty joke to tell to young women.

What is, my lord?	What is it, my lord?

Nothing.	Nothing.

You are merry, my lord.	You seem happy, sir.

Who, I?	Me?

Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.	Oh God, you're such a comedian. What else can a person do but be happy? Because, look, how cheerful my mother seems, and my father died only two hours ago.

Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.	No, it's been twice two months, my lord.

So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by’r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.”	That long? Well then, let the devil wear mourning, because I’m going to wear expensive furs. Good heavens! Did he die two months ago, and people still remember him? Then there's hope a great man's memory might last half a year after he's dead; but honestly, he'd better build churches, otherwise he'll be forgotten like the old hobby-horse, whose story ends with "Oh, the hobby-horse is forgotten."

What means this, my lord?	What does this mean, my lord?

Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.	Indeed, this is sneaky mischief; it means trouble.

Belike this show imports the argument of the play.	This performance probably tells us what the play is about.

We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they’ll tell all.	We'll find out from this guy: actors can't keep secrets; they'll reveal everything.

Will he tell us what this show meant?	Will he explain the meaning of this play?

Ay, or any show that you’ll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.	Yes, or any performance you present to him: don't be embarrassed to show it, he won't be embarrassed to tell you what it means.

You are naught, you are naught: I’ll mark the play.	You're nothing, you're nothing: I'll pay attention to the play.

For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. (Exit.)	We ask you to listen patiently to our story and our sad play.

Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?	Is this the beginning, or a short poem from a ring?

’Tis brief, my lord.	It's short, my lord.

As woman’s love.	Like a woman's love.

Full thirty times hath Phoebus’ cart gone round Neptune’s salt wash and Tellus’ orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow’d sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands.	Thirty years have passed since the sun circled the earth and sea, and three hundred and sixty moons have shone on the world, since love and marriage joined us together.

So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o’er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women’s fear and love holds quantity; In neither aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.	It may be a long time before we see each other again, but I’m worried about you. You’ve been so unwell recently, so unlike your usual self, that I don’t trust you. But even though I distrust you, I must not upset you, my lord. A woman’s fear and love are always in proportion: either she feels nothing, or she feels everything intensely. You know how much I love you; my fear is the same size as my love. When love is strong, even the smallest doubts become fears. When small fears grow big, it means love is growing stronger too.

’Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour’d, beloved; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou—	Honestly, I must leave you, my love, and soon; my body is failing and can no longer function. You will live on in this beautiful world, respected and loved, and hopefully you will find a husband just as kind.

O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill’d the first.	Damn the rest! This kind of love must be betrayal in my heart! If I marry a second husband, let me be cursed! No one marries a second time unless they killed the first husband.

(Aside.) Wormwood, wormwood.	(To himself.) Bitter, bitter.

The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed.	People remarry mostly for financial security, not love. It's like I'm killing my first husband again when my second husband kisses me.

I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity: Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary ’tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For ’tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.	I believe you mean what you're saying right now, but we often break our promises. Our intentions are slaves to our memories, born strong but weak in reality. Like unripe fruit, they cling to the tree now, but they fall without being shaken when they ripen. It’s essential that we forget the promises we make to ourselves, because when the strong emotion that made us promise fades, the promise is lost. Intense grief or joy destroy the things they create. Where joy is strongest, grief is deepest; grief finds joy, and joy finds grief, on slight events. This world doesn’t last forever, and it's not surprising that our love changes with our luck. It's still a question whether love leads to fortune or fortune leads to love. When a powerful man falls, his favorites desert him. When a poor man rises, he makes friends of his enemies. Up to now, love depends on fortune, because those who don't need help will never lack friends, and those who test a false friend in need will quickly find him an enemy. But, to end where I started, our desires and our fates are so opposed that our plans are always ruined. We control our thoughts, but not what happens because of them. So, think you won't marry a second husband, and let your thoughts die with your first husband.

Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor’s cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife!	May the earth not feed me, nor the sky give me light! May fun and rest be kept from me always! May my trust and hope become despair! May my entire world be the loneliness of a prisoner! May everything that kills joy ruin whatever good I try to do! May endless conflict follow me now and after death, if I ever remarry after being a widow!

If she should break it now!	If she breaks it now!

’Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep. (Sleeps.)	A solemn vow is made. Darling, leave me here for a bit; I’m getting tired, and I want to pass the long day by sleeping. (Sleeps.)

Sleep rock thy brain; And never come mischance between us twain! (Exit.)	May sleep soothe your mind, and may nothing bad ever come between us!

Madam, how like you this play?	Madam, how do you like this play?

The lady doth protest too much, methinks.	I think she's protesting too much.

O, but she’ll keep her word.	Oh, but she will keep her promise.

Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in’t?	Did you hear the play? Is there nothing offensive in it?

No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i’ the world.	No, no, they're just joking, joking about poison; no harm done at all.

What do you call the play?	What's the name of the play?

The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke’s name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; ’tis a knavish piece of work: but what o’ that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.	The Mousetrap. Really? How? Figuratively. This play is a representation of a murder that happened in Vienna: the duke's name is Gonzago, and his wife is Baptista. You’ll see soon enough; it’s a deceitful piece of work, but so what? Your majesty and those of us with clear consciences, it doesn’t affect us. Let the guilty person complain, we are innocent.

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.	This is Lucianus, the king's nephew.

You are as good as a chorus, my lord.	You're like a running commentary, my lord.

I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.	I could help you talk to your lover if I could see the puppets flirting.

You are keen, my lord, you are keen.	You're sharp, my lord, you're sharp.

It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.	It would be painful for you to calm me down.

Still better, and worse.	Getting better, and worse, at the same time.

So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: “the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.”	So you must choose your husbands now. Start, murderer! Damn it, stop with the evil expressions and begin! Come: "The raven's croak cries out for revenge."

Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property, On wholesome life usurp immediately. (Pours the poison into the sleeper’s ears.)	Dark thoughts, willing hands, suitable poison, and the perfect moment all come together. The time is right, when no one is watching. You foul concoction, gathered from weeds at midnight, cursed three times by Hecate, your deadly power should now take hold of this healthy life.

He poisons him i’ the garden for’s estate. His name’s Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.	He poisons him in the garden to get his property. The man’s name is Gonzago. The story exists and is written in excellent Italian. You’ll see soon how the murderer wins Gonzago’s wife's love.

The king rises.	The king stands up.

What, frighted with false fire!	What, scared by a fake display?

How fares my lord?	How are you, my lord?

Give o’er the play.	Stop the play.

Give me some light: away!	Bring me some light; let's go!

Lights, lights, lights! (Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.)	More lights! (Everyone exits except Hamlet and Horatio.)

Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away. Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers—if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me—with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?	Okay, let the wounded deer go cry, let the unwounded deer play; because some have to stay awake, while others sleep: That's how the world works. Wouldn't all this, sir, along with a ton of fancy feathers—if everything else I own goes bad—and two fancy ribbons on my slashed shoes, get me a job with a group of actors, sir?

Half a share.	A small portion.

A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself; and now reigns here A very, very—pajock.	I am a complete person. You know, my dear friend, this kingdom was once ruled by a great king, like Jupiter himself. But now, a peacock—a ridiculous creature—rules here.

You might have rhymed.	You could have made it rhyme.

O good Horatio, I’ll take the ghost’s word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?	Okay, Horatio, I'd bet anything on what the ghost said. Did you understand?

Very well, my lord.	Okay, my lord.

Upon the talk of the poisoning?	About the rumors of the poisoning?

I did very well note him.	I watched him carefully.

Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy. Come, some music!	Alright, let's have some music! Get the recorders! Because if the king doesn't enjoy the play, well then, I guess he just doesn't enjoy it, really. Let's have some music!

Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.	Please, my lord, may I have a word with you?

Sir, a whole history.	Sir, it's a long story.

The king, sir—	Is the king—?

Ay, sir, what of him?	Yes, sir, what about him?

Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.	He's acting strangely in his seclusion.

With drink, sir?	Would you like a drink, sir?

No, my lord, rather with choler.	No, my lord, I'm angry.

Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.	You should use your wisdom to tell his doctor this. If I try to purge him myself, I might make him even angrier.

Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair.	Please, my lord, get to the point and don't stray so far from what we're discussing.

I am tame, sir: pronounce.	I'm ready, sir. Speak.

The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.	Your mother, the Queen, is very upset and has sent me to you.

You are welcome.	Welcome.

Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.	No, my lord, this kindness isn't genuine. If you'll give me a straight answer, I'll do what your mother asked. If not, I'll say goodbye and leave.

Sir, I cannot.	Sir, I am unable to.

What, my lord?	What is it, sir?

Make you a wholesome answer; my wit’s diseased: but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say—	I'll give you a sensible answer if I could, but I'm not thinking clearly. However, sir, you can have whatever answer I'm capable of giving, or rather, whatever my mother wants me to say. So, let's get to the point: My mother, you were saying—

Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration.	So, she says your actions have shocked and impressed her.

O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration? Impart.	Oh, amazing son, who can shock his mother so much! But is there more to this that I should know? Tell me.

She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.	She wants to talk to you in her private room before you go to sleep.

We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?	We will obey, even if she were our mother ten times over. Do you have any more business with us?

My lord, you once did love me.	My lord, you used to love me.

So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.	I swear I do, by these hands.

Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.	My lord, what's upsetting you? You're only hurting yourself if you don't tell your friend what's bothering you.

Sir, I lack advancement.	Sir, I have no promotion.

How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?	How can that be true, when you have the king's own approval to be the next ruler of Denmark?

Ay, but sir, “While the grass grows,”—the proverb is something musty.	Yes, but sir, "While the grass grows"—that saying is a bit stale.

O, the recorders! let me see one. (To withdraw with you:)—why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?	Oh, the recorders! Let me see one. (I want to talk to you privately.) Why are you trying to get behind me, like you're trying to trap me?

O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.	Oh, my lord, if my obligation seems too forward, my love is even more impolite.

I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?	I don't understand that. Will you play this flute?

My lord, I cannot.	My lord, I can't.

I pray you.	Please.

Believe me, I cannot.	Trust me, I can't.

I do beseech you.	Please.

I know no touch of it, my lord.	I don't know anything about it, my lord.

’Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.	It's as easy as lying. Control these holes with your fingers and thumb, blow into it, and it will play the most beautiful music. See, these are the finger holes.

But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.	But I can't force them to make beautiful music; I don't have the talent.

Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. ’Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.	See how you underestimate me! You're trying to manipulate me, pretending you know how I work. You want to get to the bottom of my secrets, explore my entire range of emotions. There's a lot to me, a great depth, but you can't get me to reveal it. God, do you think I'm easier to control than a flute? Call me whatever instrument you want, you can annoy me, but you can't control me.

My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.	My lord, the Queen wants to talk to you, right now.

Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?	Do you see that cloud over there that looks almost like a camel?

By the mass, and ’tis like a camel, indeed.	By the Mass, and it truly looks like a camel.

Methinks it is like a weasel.	I think it looks like a weasel.

It is backed like a weasel.	He's got a crooked back.

Or like a whale?	Or like a whale?

Very like a whale.	Looks just like a whale.

Then I will come to my mother by and by. (They fool me to the top of my bent.) I will come by and by.	I'll go to my mother soon. (They're manipulating me as much as they possibly can.) I'll go soon.

I will say so.	I'll say it.

By and by is easily said. (Exit Polonius.) Leave me, friends. (Exeunt all but Hamlet.)	"Coming right up" is easy to say. (Polonius exits.) Leave me alone, friends. (Everyone exits except Hamlet.)

How now! what news?	Hey! What's up?

Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: This to your majesty; this to the queen.	Letters, sir, from Hamlet: this one's for you, your majesty; this one's for the queen.

From Hamlet! who brought them?	From Hamlet! Who brought them here?

Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not: They were given me by Claudio; he received them Of him that brought them.	Sailors, my lord, that's what they tell me. I didn't see them myself. Claudio sent them to me; he got them from whoever delivered them.

Laertes, you shall hear them. (Exit Messenger.)	Laertes, you will hear what they have to say.

(Reads.) “High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.	(Reading.) "Your Highness, you should know I was left with nothing in your country."

To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.	Tomorrow I'll ask permission to see you, the king. When I do, after apologizing for it, I'll explain why I came back so suddenly and unexpectedly.

Hamlet.”	Good Hamlet.

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?	What could this mean? Have all the others returned? Or is this a trick, and it isn't really happening?

Know you the hand?	Do you recognize the handwriting?

’Tis Hamlet’s character.	That's Hamlet's personality.

“Naked!” And in a postscript here, he says “alone.” Can you advise me?	"Naked!" And then added here, he writes "alone." What do you think I should do?

I’m lost in it, my lord.	I'm confused, my lord.

But let him come; It warms the very sickness in my heart, That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, “Thus didest thou.”	Let him come; it makes my heart feel better, even though I'm sick with grief, knowing I'll live long enough to confront him and say, "This is what you did."

If it be so, Laertes— As how should it be so? how otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?	If that's true, Laertes—but how could it be? How could it be any other way?—will you take my advice?

Ay, my lord; So you will not o’errule me to a peace.	Yes, my lord; as long as you don't force me to make peace.

To thine own peace.	For your own well-being.

If he be now return’d, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident.	If he has come back now, as if he gave up on his trip and doesn't plan to continue, I will manipulate him into a dangerous plan I've been working on, one he'll certainly fail at. When he dies, no one will blame me; even his mother will dismiss it as an accident.

My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.	My lord, I will follow your guidance, especially if you could arrange it so that I am the one who carries it out.

It falls right.	That seems correct.

You have been talk’d of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.	Since you've been traveling, people have been talking about you a lot, and Hamlet's heard it. They say you excel in a certain skill, and your combined talents never made him as jealous as that single one, which, in my opinion, is the least impressive.

What part is that, my lord?	What role is that, my lord?

A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness.	A youthful flirtation, though necessary; young people look just as good in casual, carefree clothes as old people do in serious, dark outfits that suggest health and wisdom.

Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy:— I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback: but this gallant Had witchcraft in’t; he grew unto his seat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast: so far he topp’d my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.	Just two months ago, a nobleman from Normandy was here. I’ve fought against the French myself, and they're good riders, but this guy was like a magician. He became one with his horse, and made it do such incredible things, it was like they were a single creature, half-man, half-horse. He was so much better than anything I could imagine that I couldn't even come close to imitating his skills.

A Norman was’t?	Was it a Norman?

A Norman.	A Frenchman.

Upon my life, Lamond.	I swear, it's Lamond.

The very same.	Exactly.

I know him well: he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.	I know him well: he really is the jewel and pride of our country.

He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especial, That he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them.	He admitted he knew you, and praised your skill so highly—your technique and practice in defending yourself, and especially your swordsmanship—that he exclaimed it would be amazing to see you fight. He swore that the fencers of their country would have no chance against you, with no movement, guard, or awareness.

Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o’er, to play with him. Now, out of this—	Sir, this account of him so poisoned Hamlet with envy that he could do nothing but wish and plead for your quick return to fence with him. And because of this—

What out of this, my lord?	What does this mean, my lord?

Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?	Laertes, did you truly love your father? Or are you just pretending to be sad, showing the appearance of grief but feeling nothing inside?

Why ask you this?	Why are you asking this?

Not that I think you did not love your father; But that I know love is begun by time; And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.	It's not that I don't believe you loved your father; But I know love starts gradually over time; And I see evidence that time changes and weakens even the strongest love.

There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too much: that we would do, We should do when we would; for this “would” changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this “should” is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing.	Even in the hottest love, there's something that will weaken it. Nothing stays perfectly good forever. Goodness, when it becomes excessive, destroys itself. What we want to do, we should do when we want to, because that "want" changes and faces as many obstacles and delays as there are people, actions, and unforeseen events. And then this "should" becomes like a relieved sigh that actually causes harm.

But, to the quick o’ the ulcer:— Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, To show yourself your father’s son in deed More than in words?	Let's get to the heart of the problem: Hamlet's coming back. What would you do to prove you're truly your father's son, not just in what you say, but in what you do?

To cut his throat i’ the church.	To kill him in the church.

No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds.	Murder should have no safe haven anywhere. Revenge should have no limits.

But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.	Good Laertes, will you do this: stay in your room.

Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home: We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads: he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father.	When Hamlet comes back, he’ll know you’re here. We’ll get people to sing your praises, and build on the reputation the Frenchman gave you, then we'll match you both up. He, being careless and trusting, won’t check the swords carefully. So you can easily, or with a little trickery, pick a sword that isn’t blunted, and in a practice bout, avenge your father.

I will do’t: And, for that purpose, I’ll anoint my sword.	I will do it. And to that end, I'll poison my sword.

I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch’d withal: I’ll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.	I bought poison from a con man, so deadly that if you just dip a knife in it, and it draws blood, no medicine, no matter how rare or made from the most potent herbs, can save the person who's even scratched by it. I'll touch my sword tip with this poison, so that if I just graze him, it will kill him.

Let’s further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, ’Twere better not assay’d: therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof.	Let's think about this more; consider how the timing and resources we have can help us succeed. If this plan fails, and our poor execution reveals our intentions, it would have been better not to try at all. Therefore, this plan should have a backup, a second option that can work if this one fails.

Soft! let me see: We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha’t.	Wait! Let me think. We'll make a serious bet on your skills: I've got it.

When in your motion you are hot and dry— As make your bouts more violent to that end— And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck, Our purpose may hold there.	When you're all hot and thirsty from moving around—as you'll make happen by fighting even harder—and he asks for a drink, I'll have a cup ready for the occasion. If he happens to survive your poisoned stab, our plan can still succeed there.

How now, sweet queen!	What's up, sweet queen?

One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow: your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.	One disaster follows right after another, so quickly: your sister, Laertes, has drowned.

Drown’d! O, where?	Drowned! Oh, where?

There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook.	A willow tree leans over the stream, its pale leaves reflected in the water. Ophelia came there with strange, beautiful garlands made of wildflowers, nettles, daisies, and orchids (which shepherds call something crude, but young women call dead men's fingers). As she climbed the hanging branches to decorate them with her flower crown, a spiteful branch broke, and she fell into the brook with her flowers.

Her clothes spread wide; And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element: but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.	Her clothes spread out around her, and like a mermaid, they kept her afloat for a while. During that time, she sang bits of old songs, as if unaware of her own danger, or like a creature born and accustomed to the water. But it couldn't last long before her clothes, heavy with water, dragged the poor girl from her beautiful singing to a muddy death.

Alas, then, she is drown’d?	Oh no, so she's drowned?

Drown’d, drown’d.	Dead. Dead.

Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out.	You've had too much water already, poor Ophelia, so I won't cry. But it's just what we do; human nature takes over, no matter how shameful it seems. Once the tears stop, the woman in me will be gone.

Adieu, my lord: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it. (Exit.)	Goodbye, my lord. I have an impassioned speech that desperately wants to burst out, but this foolishness suppresses it. (Exits.)

Let’s follow, Gertrude: How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let’s follow. (Exeunt.)	Let's go after him, Gertrude. I had such a hard time calming him down! Now I'm afraid this will set him off again, so let's follow him. (They exit.)

Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation?	Should she be buried with Christian rites when she deliberately took her own life?

I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.	I'm telling you, yes. Go prepare her grave right away. The coroner investigated her death and has ruled that she should receive a Christian burial.

How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?	How could that happen, unless she killed herself to protect her reputation?

Why, ’tis found so.	Well, that's what we've found.

It must be “se offendendo;” it cannot be else.	It must be "while offending"; it can't be anything else.

For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.	Because here's the thing: if I knowingly drown myself, it implies a deliberate action. And an action has three parts: the intention, the execution, and the completion. Therefore, she knowingly drowned herself.

Nay, but hear you, goodman delver—	Hey, listen to me, gravedigger—

Give me leave.	Let me go.

Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good: if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes—mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.	Here's the water; good. Here's the man; good. If the man goes to the water and drowns himself, he does it willingly or unwillingly, but he goes—remember that. But if the water comes to him and drowns him, he doesn't drown himself. Therefore, someone who isn't responsible for their own death doesn't shorten their own life.

But is this law?	Is this legal?

Ay, marry, is’t; crowner’s quest law.	Yes, of course it is; it's the law according to the coroner's inquest.

Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.	Do you want the honest truth? If she hadn't been a noblewoman, she wouldn't have been allowed a Christian burial.

Why, there thou say’st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian.	Well, there you have it. It’s a shame that rich people get away with suicide more easily than regular people.

Come, my spade.	Give me my shovel.

There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.	The only truly old nobility are gardeners, ditch-diggers, and gravediggers: they carry on Adam's original job.

Was he a gentleman?	Was he a man of noble birth?

A’ was the first that ever bore arms.	He was the first ever to carry weapons.

Why, he had none.	Well, he didn't have any.

What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says “Adam digged:” could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—	What, are you an idiot? Do you even understand the Bible? The Bible says Adam dug; could he dig without arms? I'll ask you another question: if you don't answer properly, confess your sins.

Go to.	Come on.

What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?	Who builds stronger things than a bricklayer, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?

The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.	The person who builds gallows; because that structure lasts longer than a thousand people who live in houses.

I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee.	I really like your humor, honestly. The gallows is useful; but how is it useful? It's useful to those who do wrong. Now, you're wrong to say the gallows is built stronger than the church. Therefore, the gallows might be useful to you.

To’t again, come.	Try again, come on.

“Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?”	Who builds stronger than a bricklayer, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?

Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.	Yes, tell me that, and I'll be at ease.

Marry, now I can tell.	Indeed, now I can tell you.

To’t.	Get to it.

Mass, I cannot tell.	Honestly, I don't know.

Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say “a grave-maker:” the houses that he makes last till doomsday.	Don't rack your brain about it anymore; your stupid mind won't work any faster by forcing it. And when you're asked that question again, say "a gravedigger:" the houses he makes last until the end of the world.

Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a stoup of liquor. (Exit Second Clown. He digs and sings.)	Go, get yourself to the tavern: bring me a jug of alcohol.

In youth, when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet, To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove, O, methought, there was nothing meet.	When I was young and in love, I thought it was wonderful to shorten the time, oh, for my benefit. It seemed nothing was as good.

Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?	Doesn't this guy realize what he's doing, singing while digging graves?

Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.	He's used to it, so it's easy for him.

’Tis e’en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.	That's right: those who don't work hard have more delicate feelings.

(Sings.) But age, with his stealing steps, Hath claw’d me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such.	(Singing) But old age, creeping up on me, Has grabbed me in its grasp and sent me to the grave, as if I never mattered.

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain’s jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o’er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?	That skull used to be able to talk and sing. Look how the fool slams it down like it's the jawbone Cain used to commit the first murder! It might have been the head of a politician that this idiot is now digging up; someone who would try to outsmart God, wouldn't you think?

It might, my lord.	It could, my lord.

Or of a courtier; which could say “Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?” This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?	Or a nobleman who would say, "Good morning, sweet lord! How are you, good lord?" This could be someone like that lord, who praised that other lord's horse when he really wanted to ask for it; couldn't it?

Ay, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton’s spade: here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t.	Yes, exactly like that: and now she belongs to Lady Worm; her jaw is gone, and her skull's been smashed around with a gravedigger's shovel. Here's a lovely change, if we knew how to see it.

Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with ’em? mine ache to think on’t.	Weren't these bones once used to raise someone? Is that all they're good for now, just tossing around like sticks? It hurts me to even think about it.

(Sings.) A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet: O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.	(Singing) A pickaxe and a shovel, a shovel, And a burial cloth: Oh, a clay grave must be made Because this guest deserves it.

There’s another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?	Here's another thought: why couldn't that be the skull of a lawyer? Where are his clever arguments now, his subtle distinctions, his legal cases, his land holdings, and his tricks? Why does he let this clumsy fool hit him on the head with a dirty shovel, and not sue him for assault?

Hum!	Hmm.

This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?	This guy probably bought a lot of land back in the day, with all his legal documents. Is this what all those deals and court cases got him? A bald head full of dirt? Will his guarantees get him nothing more of all his property, even with double guarantees, than what can fit on a contract? The documents for his land won't even fit in this box. And does the person who inherited it get nothing more than this?

Not a jot more, my lord.	Not at all, my lord.

Is not parchment made of sheepskins?	Isn't parchment made from sheepskins?

Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.	Yes, sir, and made of calfskin as well.

They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that.	They're like sheep and cows, looking for safety in numbers.

I will speak to this fellow.	I'll talk to this guy.

Whose grave’s this, sirrah?	Hey, whose grave is this?

Mine, sir. (Sings.) O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.	Mine, sir. (Singing.) Oh, a grave is just the right thing to make for a guest like that.

I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in’t.	I think it's yours, actually; because you're lying about it.

You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in’t, and yet it is mine.	You're wrong about that, sir, so it's not yours. As for me, I'm not lying about it, and yet it is mine.

Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine: ’tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.	You're lying, claiming it's yours while you're in it: it's for the dead, not the living; so you're lying.

’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’twill away again, from me to you.	That was a fast lie, sir; it went quickly from me to you.

What man dost thou dig it for?	Who are you digging this grave for?

For no man, sir.	For no one, sir.

What woman, then?	So, who is she?

For none, neither.	No one, not even one person.

Who is to be buried in’t?	Who's going to be buried in it?

One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.	She used to be a woman, sir; but may her soul rest in peace, she's dead.

How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us.	That guy's a complete fool! We have to be precise, or being vague will ruin us.

By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe.	I swear, Horatio, I've noticed it for the past three years; society has become so refined that the commoner's shoe almost steps on the nobleman's heel, annoying him.

How long hast thou been a grave-maker?	How long have you been a gravedigger?

Of all the days i’ the year, I came to’t that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.	Of all the days in the year, it happened on the day our last King Hamlet defeated Fortinbras.

How long is that since?	How long ago was that?

Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England.	Can't you figure that out? Any idiot can tell you that: it was the very day young Hamlet was born; the one who's crazy and was sent to England.

Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?	Yes, indeed, why was he sent to England?

Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it’s no great matter there.	Well, because he was crazy. He'll get his sanity back there. And if he doesn't, it's not a big deal.

Why?	Why?

’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.	They won't notice it in him there; the men there are just as crazy as he is.

How came he mad?	How did he go crazy?

Very strangely, they say.	They say it was very strange.

How strangely?	How odd?

Faith, e’en with losing his wits.	Indeed, even when he was going crazy.

Upon what ground?	On what basis?

Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.	Well, here in Denmark: I've been a gravedigger here, man and boy, for thirty years.

How long will a man lie i’ the earth ere he rot?	How long does it take for a man to rot in the ground?

I’ faith, if he be not rotten before he die—as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in—he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.	Honestly, if he doesn't decay before he dies—and we have many diseased corpses these days that barely stay together long enough to be buried—he'll last you about eight or nine years. A leather maker will last you nine years.

Why he more than another?	Why him and not someone else?

Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.	Well, his skin is so toughened from his job that it will keep water out for a long time; and water really makes a mess of your damn dead body.

Here’s a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years.	Here's a skull; this skull has been in the ground for twenty-three years.

Whose was it?	Whose was this?

A whoreson mad fellow’s it was: whose do you think it was?	It belonged to some crazy, low-life guy. Who do you think it belonged to?

Nay, I know not.	No, I don't know.

A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a’ poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.	A curse on him, the crazy rascal! He once dumped a whole bottle of Rhine wine on my head.

This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the king’s jester.	This skull, sir, belonged to Yorick, the king's clown.

This?	Is it this?

E’en that.	Just that.

Let me see. (Takes the skull.)	Let me look. (Picks up the skull.)

Alas, poor Yorick!	Oh, poor Yorick!

I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it.	I knew him, Horatio: a guy with an endless sense of humor, with a wonderful imagination. He carried me on his back a thousand times; and now, how disgusting it is to think about! It makes me want to throw up.

Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.	Here hung those lips I've kissed countless times.

Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that.	Where are your jokes now? Your playful jumps? Your songs? Your bursts of laughter that used to make everyone at the table roar? Not a single one now to make fun of your own grinning face? Completely downcast? Now go to my lady’s room and tell her that no matter how much makeup she wears, she’ll end up looking like this; make her laugh at that if you can.

Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.	Please, Horatio, tell me one thing.

What’s that, my lord?	What is it, sir?

Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ the earth?	Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this in the ground?

E’en so.	Just so.

And smelt so? pah! (Puts down the skull.)	And smelled like that? Ugh! (Puts down the skull.)

E’en so, my lord.	Yes, my lord.

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole?	Think about how low we can sink, Horatio! Why can't we imagine Alexander the Great's dust eventually ending up plugging a beer barrel?

’Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.	Thinking about it too much is, well, thinking about it too much.

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?	No, honestly, not at all. But to follow him there with enough restraint, and a good chance of leading it, like this: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander turns to dust. The dust is earth. We make clay from earth. So why couldn't they use that clay, which he became, to plug a beer barrel?

Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw! But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king,	Even mighty Caesar, now dead and turned to dust, could be used to plug a hole and keep the wind out. Oh, how the earth that once inspired fear in the world could end up patching a wall to block the winter wind! But wait, be quiet, step aside: here comes the king.

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life: ’twas of some estate.	The queen and her people, who are they following? And with such incomplete ceremonies? This suggests the dead person took their own life in despair: they must have been someone important.

Couch we awhile, and mark.	Let's hide and watch.

What ceremony else?	What other rituals are there?

That is Laertes, A very noble youth: mark.	That's Laertes, a really great young man: pay attention.

What ceremony else?	What other rituals are there?

Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty: her death was doubtful; And, but that great command o’ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers, Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her: Yet here she is allow’d her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial.	We gave her as much funeral as we were allowed. Her death was questionable. If the King hadn't overruled the rules, she would have been buried in unconsecrated ground until Judgment Day. Instead of prayers, people would have thrown broken pottery, stones, and pebbles on her grave. But here she is, being given a proper burial with virgin wreaths, flowers scattered on her grave, and the ringing of bells.

Must there no more be done?	Is there nothing else to do?

No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.	Let's stop now. We would dishonor the dead to sing a funeral hymn and wish her the kind of rest given to those who die in peace.

Lay her i’ the earth: And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!	Bury her in the ground, and may violets grow from her beautiful and pure flesh!

I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling.	I'm telling you, you rude priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven when you're in hell, screaming.

What, the fair Ophelia!	What, beautiful Ophelia!

Sweets to the sweet: farewell! (Scattering flowers.)	Goodbye, sweet girl, I'm giving you these flowers.

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid, And not have strew’d thy grave.	I hoped you would have been my son Hamlet's wife; I imagined decorating your wedding bed, sweet girl, not scattering flowers on your grave.

O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!	Oh, may pain, multiplied thirty times over, strike that cursed person who robbed you of your sanity with their evil act!

Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms: (Leaps into the grave.)	Wait, someone hold me back from the grave for a moment, until I've held her in my arms one last time.

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o’ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.	Now throw your dirt on the living and the dead, until you’ve made a mountain of this plain, taller than Mount Pelion or the sky-high peak of blue Olympus.

(Advancing.)	Forward.

What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. (Leaps into the grave.)	Who is it whose sadness is so strong? Whose words of grief move the stars in the sky, and make them stop and listen as if they were hurt by what they hear? It is I, Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.

The devil take thy soul! (Grappling with him.)	May the devil take your soul!

Thou pray’st not well.	You're not praying right.

I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I something in me dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.	Please, take your hands off my neck. Even though I'm not easily angered or quick to act, I have a dangerous side you should be afraid of. Let go of me.

Pluck them asunder.	Tear them apart.

Hamlet, Hamlet!	Hamlet, Hamlet!

Gentlemen—	Friends,

Good my lord, be quiet. (The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.)	My lord, please calm down.

Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.	I'll fight him about this until I can't keep my eyes open anymore.

O my son, what theme?	Oh, my son, what's wrong?

I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.	I loved Ophelia. Even if forty thousand brothers combined all their love, it still wouldn't equal the amount I feel.

What wilt thou do for her?	What will you do for her?

O, he is mad, Laertes.	Oh, Laertes, he's crazy.

For love of God, forbear him.	For God's sake, leave him alone.

’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do: Woo’t weep? woo’t fight? woo’t fast? woo’t tear thyself? Woo’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I’ll do’t.	Damn it, show me what you'll do! Will you weep? Will you fight? Will you fast? Will you hurt yourself? Will you drink vinegar? Eat a crocodile? I'll do it!

Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I: And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou’lt mouth, I’ll rant as well as thou.	Did you come here to complain? To try to impress me by jumping into her grave? Be buried alive with her, and so will I! And if you talk about mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us, until our ground, scorching the sun's head, makes Mount Ossa look like a bump! No, if you're going to yell, I'll yell just as loud as you.

This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.	This is just madness. For a while, these fits will keep affecting him. Soon, he'll be as calm as a dove when her baby birds hatch, and he'll be silent and sad again.

Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I loved you ever: but it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day. (Exit.)	Listen, sir. Why are you treating me like this? I have always loved you, but it doesn't matter anymore. Even if Hercules himself tried to change things, a cat will still meow and a dog will still have its day. (Leaves.)

I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. (Exit Horatio.)	Please, Horatio, do me a favor and stay with him.

Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech; We’ll put the matter to the present push.	Be patient and remember what we talked about last night; we'll bring this to a head now.

Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.	Good Gertrude, keep an eye on your son.

This grave shall have a living monument: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. (Exeunt.)	This grave will have a lasting memorial. We will have a peaceful moment soon. Until then, let's proceed with patience. (They exit.)

So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance?	That's enough about this, sir. Now you'll see the other thing. Do you remember everything that happened?

Remember it, my lord?	Do you remember it, sir?

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep: methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us There’s a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will—	Sir, I felt a kind of inner turmoil that kept me awake. I felt worse than mutineers in chains. Impulsively – and thank goodness for that impulsiveness – we should realize that our recklessness sometimes helps us when our careful plans fail. And that should teach us that there is a God who guides our destinies, no matter how roughly we try to shape them ourselves.

That is most certain.	That's absolutely true.

Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark Groped I to find out them; had my desire, Finger’d their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio— O royal knavery!—an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too, With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.	I got up from my room, wrapped my sea cloak around me, and in the dark I felt my way to find them. I found what I was looking for, grabbed their package, and then went back to my room. I forgot my manners, ignoring my fear, and dared to open their important orders. Inside, Horatio, I found—what royal treachery!—a clear order, filled with many different kinds of reasons claiming it was for the good of Denmark and England, saying that my existence was full of such threats and dangers, that upon inspection, without any delay, not even time to sharpen the axe, my head should be cut off.

Is’t possible?	Is that possible?

Here’s the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?	Here are your orders: read them later at your convenience. But do you want to hear how I handled things?

I beseech you.	I beg you.

Being thus be-netted round with villainies— Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play—I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair and labour’d much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman’s service: wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?	Being completely surrounded by evil plots— before I could even start thinking clearly, they had already begun to act—I sat down and wrote a new order, wrote it clearly and carefully. I used to think, like politicians do, that writing neatly was beneath me and tried hard to unlearn it, but now it was extremely useful to me. Do you want to know what I wrote?

Ay, good my lord.	Yes, my good lord.

An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma ’tween their amities, And many such-like “As”es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow’d.	A serious order from the king, because England was loyal to him, because their friendship could grow like a palm tree, because peace should always be between them, and many similar important reasons, that, after reading this letter, without any further discussion, he should immediately kill the people who bring it, not even allowing them time for confession.

How was this seal’d?	How was this confirmed?

Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscribed it, gave’t the impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.	Well, even in that, heaven was in control. I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, which was the exact design of the Danish seal. I folded the order to match the other one, signed it, stamped it with the seal, and put it back securely, and the switch was never noticed. The next day was our sea battle, and you already know what happened after that.

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are going to do it.

Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow: ’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.	Well, they were asking for it; I don't feel guilty about them at all. Their downfall is their own fault. It's dangerous when someone inferior interferes in a fight between powerful enemies.

Why, what a king is this!	Wow, what kind of king is he!

Does it not, think’st thee, stand me now upon— He that hath kill’d my king and whored my mother, Popp’d in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? and is’t not to be damn’d, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?	Don't you think, shouldn't I now—He who has killed my king and slept with my mother, interfered with the election and my chances, tried to kill me, and with such trickery—isn't it absolutely right to pay him back with my own hand? And wouldn't I be damned to let this disease of our world cause even more harm?

It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.	He needs to quickly find out from England what happened with that matter there.

It will be short: the interim is mine; And a man’s life’s no more than to say “One.” But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his: I’ll court his favours: But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.	It will be quick. I have the time to do it. A man's life can end in an instant. But I'm very sorry, my good Horatio, that I wronged Laertes. Because I see his situation mirrors my own. I'll seek his forgiveness. But, honestly, the intensity of his grief made me incredibly angry.

Peace! who comes here?	Quiet! Who's coming?

Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.	Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.

I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?	Thank you very much, sir. Do you know this annoying person?

No, my good lord.	No, my lord.

Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess: ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.	You're better off not knowing him. He owns a lot of good land. Even an animal can be lord of animals if it has enough, and it'll eat with the king. He's just a jackdaw, but, like I said, he's got a lot of land.

Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.	My lord, if you have a moment, I have a message for you from the King.

I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.	I will pay attention and listen carefully, sir. Put your hat on; that's what it's for.

I thank your lordship, it is very hot.	Thank you, my lord; it's very hot.

No, believe me, ’tis very cold; the wind is northerly.	No, trust me, it's very cold; the wind is from the north.

It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.	It's pretty cold, my lord, actually.

But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.	But I still think it's very stuffy and hot for me.

Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter—	It's extremely hot, my lord; very stuffy – I don't know how to explain it. But, my lord, the king told me to let you know that he's bet a lot of money on you. That's the situation.

I beseech you, remember—Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.	Please, remember this: Hamlet is urging him to put on his hat.

Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.	No, my lord; honestly, it's just for my comfort. Sir, Laertes has just arrived at court; believe me, he is a complete gentleman, full of outstanding qualities, very pleasant to be around, and makes a great impression. Honestly, speaking from the heart, he's the perfect example of a gentleman. You'll find in him everything that a gentleman should be.

Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.	Sir, you are a perfect reflection of him; although, I know, to list all his qualities would overwhelm even the most detailed memory, and still not fully capture his swiftness and complexity. But truly, to praise him properly, I consider him to be a person of immense importance and value; and his unique nature is so rare that the only thing like him is his own reflection. Anyone else who tries to understand him will only grasp his shadow, and nothing more.

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	Your Lordship is absolutely right about him.

The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?	What's this about, sir? Why are we talking about this man when we don't know the full story?

Sir?	Yes?

Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.	Can't you understand in another language? You really can, sir.

What imports the nomination of this gentleman?	Why is naming this man important?

Of Laertes?	About Laertes?

His purse is empty already; all’s golden words are spent.	His wallet is already empty; all his flattering words are used up.

Of him, sir.	About him, sir.

I know you are not ignorant—	I know you're not stupid.

I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?	I wish you would, sir; but honestly, if you did, it wouldn't please me much. So?

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—	You know how talented Laertes is.

I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.	I wouldn't admit that, because I'd be comparing myself to his greatness; but to truly know someone, you must know yourself.

I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.	I'm talking about his skill with a weapon, sir; but as for what they accuse him of, and the reputation he deserves, he's unmatched.

What’s his weapon?	What weapon does he use?

Rapier and dagger.	Sword and knife.

That’s two of his weapons: but, well.	Okay, he used two of his tricks/arguments/methods, but whatever.

The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.	The King, sir, has bet him six Barbary horses. Against that, he's wagered, I think, six French swords and daggers, with all their accessories like belts and hangers, and so on. Three of the sets, truly, are very beautifully designed, perfectly matching the hilts, extremely elegant, and very imaginative.

What call you the carriages?	What do you call those vehicles?

I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.	I knew you must have learned from the notes in the margin before you finished.

The carriages, sir, are the hangers.	Sir, the straps hold the carriage.

The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this “imponed,” as you call it?	It would be more relevant if we could carry cannons with us. I wish swords could suffice until then. But let's move on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their related equipment, and three fancy carriages; that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this "staked," as you call it?

The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.	The King, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and him, he won't score more than three points behind you. He's bet twelve to nine, and it would start immediately if you'd give your consent.

How if I answer “no”?	What if I say "no"?

I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.	I mean, my lord, the danger you face by fighting.

Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.	I'll walk here in the hall. If the king is okay with it, this is when I usually take my exercise. Have the swords brought, if the other guy's ready, and if the king still wants to go through with this, I'll try to win for him. If I don't, I'll only end up embarrassed and with a few bruises.

Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?	Should I just return you like this?

To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.	To that point, sir; say whatever you want after that.

I commend my duty to your lordship.	I offer my respect to you, my lord.

Yours, yours. (Exit Osric.) He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for’s turn.	Yours, yours. (Osric exits.) He has to praise it himself; no one else will do it for him.

This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.	This person is acting prematurely and immaturely.

He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. Thus has he—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.	He suckled at his mother's teat almost immediately. That's how he—and many others from the same crowd, whom this shallow generation loves—only learned the popular trends and superficial manners of the day; a kind of frothy collection of ideas that gets them through even the most carefully considered and refined opinions. But if you put them to the test, their worthlessness is revealed.

My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.	My lord, the king sent Osric to tell you he wants you to join him in the hall. He wants to know if you still want to fence with Laertes, or if you need more time.

I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king’s pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.	I am firm in my resolve; they do what the king wants. If he finds it suitable, I'm ready, now or whenever, assuming I'm as capable as I am now.

The king and queen and all are coming down.	The king, the queen, and everyone else are coming.

In happy time.	That's good timing.

The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.	The Queen wants you to be friendly and kind to Laertes before you start fencing.

She well instructs me. (Exit Lord.)	She's giving me good advice. (Lord exits.)

You will lose this wager, my lord.	You're going to lose this bet, my lord.

I do not think so: since he went into France, I have been in continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.	I don't think so. Since he went to France, I've been practicing constantly. I'll win easily. But you wouldn't believe how sick I feel inside. But it doesn't matter.

Nay, good my lord—	No, my good lord—

It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.	It's just foolishness, but it's the kind of feeling that would probably upset a woman.

If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.	If you don't feel up to anything, listen to yourself. I'll stop them from coming here and say you're not well enough.

Not a whit, we defy augury: there’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?	Not at all, we reject omens. Even a sparrow's death is under God's special care. If death is meant to happen now, it won't happen later; if it's not meant to happen later, it will happen now; and if it's not happening now, it will still happen eventually. Being prepared is everything. Since no one keeps what they leave behind anyway, what does it matter to die early?

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.	Come, Hamlet, come and take my hand.

Give me your pardon, sir: I’ve done you wrong; But pardon’t, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish’d With sore distraction. What I have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away, And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if’t be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d; His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot mine arrow o’er the house, And hurt my brother.	Please forgive me, sir. I have wronged you, but please forgive me as you are a gentleman. Everyone here knows, and you must have heard, how I am suffering from terrible madness. Anything I've done that might have offended your character, honor, and good opinion, I declare here was due to insanity. Did Hamlet wrong Laertes? Never Hamlet. If Hamlet is not himself, and when he’s not himself wrongs Laertes, then it wasn't Hamlet who did it. Hamlet denies it. Who did it then? His madness. If that's the case, Hamlet is among those who have been wronged. His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in front of this crowd, please let my declaration that I didn't intend any evil convince you that I accidentally hurt you, like shooting an arrow over the house and hitting my brother.

I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge: but in my terms of honour I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honour, I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungored. But till that time, I do receive your offer’d love like love, And will not wrong it.	Naturally, I should be eager for revenge, but my sense of honor prevents me from seeking reconciliation until respected elders give me a reason and example of how to make peace without damaging my reputation. Until then, I accept your offered love sincerely and will not betray it.

I embrace it freely; And will this brother’s wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on.	I accept it willingly and will play this brother's bet honestly. Give us the swords. Let's go.

Come, one for me.	Alright, I'll take one too.

I’ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i’ the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.	I'll be your background, Laertes: My lack of skill will make yours shine like a bright star in the darkest night.

You mock me, sir.	You're making fun of me, sir.

No, by this hand.	No, I swear it.

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?	Osric, give them the fencing swords. Hamlet, my cousin, do you know what we've bet on?

Very well, my lord; Your grace hath laid the odds o’ the weaker side.	Okay, my lord; Your highness has bet on the losing side.

I do not fear it; I have seen you both: But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.	I'm not afraid; I've seen you two fence before. But since he's improved, he now has an advantage over us.

This is too heavy, let me see another.	This one is too heavy, let me see another one.

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?	This pleases me. Are these foils all the same length?

Ay, my good lord.	Yes, my lord.

Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, “Now the king drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.	Put the wine jugs on that table. If Hamlet scores the first or second hit, or only loses on the third round, have all the cannons on the castle walls fire. The king will drink to Hamlet’s good health and put a pearl in the cup, more valuable than the ones four previous kings of Denmark have worn in their crowns. Give me the cups; let the kettle drum signal the trumpet, the trumpet signal the cannon outside, the cannons signal the sky, and the sky signal the earth, "Now the king drinks to Hamlet!" Come, let's start: and you, the judges, watch closely.

Come on, sir.	Let's go, sir.

Come, my lord. (They play.)	Let's go, my lord. (They play.)

One.	Who's there?

A hit, a very palpable hit.	A hit, a very obvious hit.

Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here’s to thy health. (Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.) Give him the cup.	Wait; give me a drink. Hamlet, this pearl is for you; Here’s to your health. (Trumpets sound, and a cannon fires inside.) Give him the cup.

I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. (They play.) Another hit; what say you?	I'll fence first. Set that aside for now. Come on. (They fence.) Another hit; what do you think?

A touch, a touch, I do confess.	A hit, a hit, I admit it.

Our son shall win.	Our son will win.

He’s fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows: The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.	He's fat and out of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead. The Queen is drinking to your success, Hamlet.

Good madam!	Hello, ma'am!

Gertrude, do not drink.	Gertrude, don't drink.

I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.	I will, my lord; please forgive me.

(Aside.) It is the poison’d cup: it is too late.	(To himself.) It's the poisoned cup: it's too late.

I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.	I don't want to drink yet, madam; I will in a little while.

Come, let me wipe thy face.	Let me wipe your face.

My lord, I’ll hit him now.	My lord, I'll strike him now.

I do not think’t.	I don't think so.

(Aside.) And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.	(To himself.) Still, it's almost against my conscience.

Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence; I am afeard you make a wanton of me.	Come on, Laertes, for the third round. You're just playing around. Please, attack me with everything you've got. I'm afraid you're treating me like a spoiled child.

Say you so? come on. (They play.)	Is that so? Let's go. (They play.)

Nothing, neither way.	Either way, nothing.

Have at you now! (Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.)	Now I'll get you!

Part them; they are incensed.	Separate them; they are enraged.

Nay, come, again. (The Queen falls.)	No, stop, again. (The Queen falls.)

Look to the queen there, ho!	Look at the Queen over there!

They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?	They're both bleeding. What's going on, my lord?

How is’t, Laertes?	How are you, Laertes?

Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.	Well, like a woodcock caught in my own trap, Osric; I am rightly killed by my own trickery.

How does the queen?	How is the queen doing?

She swounds to see them bleed.	She faints when she sees them bleeding.

No, no, the drink, the drink—O my dear Hamlet— The drink, the drink! I am poison’d. (Dies.)	No, no, the drink, the drink—oh, my dear Hamlet—The drink, the drink! I've been poisoned. (Dies.)

O villany! Ho! let the door be lock’d: Treachery! Seek it out.	Oh, villainy! Hey! Lock the door! Treachery! Find it.

It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom’d: the foul practice Hath turn’d itself on me; lo, here I lie, Never to rise again: thy mother’s poison’d: I can no more: the king, the king’s to blame.	It's here, Hamlet: Hamlet, you are dead; no medicine can save you; you have less than thirty minutes to live. The poisoned sword is in your hand, not blunted. The evil plot has backfired on me; look, I'm dying here and will never get up again. Your mother has been poisoned. I can't speak anymore. The king is to blame.

The point envenom’d too! Then, venom, to thy work. (Stabs the King.)	The sword was poisoned as well! Then, poison, do your job. (Stabs the King.)

Treason! treason!	Betrayal! Betrayal!

O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.	Oh, protect me still, friends; I'm only wounded.

Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. (King dies.)	Here, you incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink this poison! Is your marriage to my mother here? Follow her to hell.

He is justly served; It is a poison temper’d by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me! (Dies.)	He got what he deserved; it was poison he prepared himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: don’t let my death and my father's death be on your conscience, and don’t let your death be on mine! (Dies.)

Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time—as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest—O, I could tell you— But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.	May God forgive you for what's happened! I'm coming with you. I'm dying, Horatio. Goodbye, poor queen! You who look shocked and are trembling at this event, who are just silent observers to this tragedy, if I only had time—but death, that cruel officer, is taking me into custody—oh, I could explain everything—but forget it. Horatio, I'm dying; you'll live. Tell my story and explain what happened to those who don't understand.

Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here’s yet some liquor left.	Don't believe it. I'm more like an ancient Roman than a Dane. There's still some drink left.

As thou’rt a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I’ll have’t. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. March afar off, and shot within. What warlike noise is this?	If you're a man, give me the cup; let go! By God, I'll take it! Oh, good Horatio, what a damaged reputation I'll leave behind me with all this unknown! If you ever cared for me, stay away from happiness for a while and live in this painful world to tell my story. [Sound of marching and gunfire in the distance.] What is that noise of war?

Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.	Young Fortinbras, returning victorious from Poland, gives this loud and aggressive greeting to the English ambassadors.

O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England; But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence. (Dies.)	I am dying, Horatio. The strong poison has completely overcome me. I won't live to hear the news from England, but I predict that Fortinbras will be chosen as king. He has my vote as I die. Tell him everything that has happened, big and small, that led to this. The rest is silence. (Dies.)

Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince; And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? (March within.)	A great man's heart is breaking. Goodbye, sweet prince; may angels lead you to peace! Why is the drum approaching? (Marching sound inside.)

Where is this sight?	Where is this thing I'm seeing?

What is it ye would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.	What do you want to see? If it's sadness or something amazing, stop looking.

This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?	This pile of bodies cries out "destruction!" Oh, arrogant death, what kind of celebration are you planning in your endless tomb, that you've killed so many leaders so brutally all at once?

The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: Where should we have our thanks?	This is a depressing sight. News from England has arrived too late. The ears that should have heard the news—that his command to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern has been carried out—are now deaf. So, who is left to thank for this?

Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall’n on the inventors’ heads: all this can I Truly deliver.	Even if he could speak, he wouldn't thank you. He never ordered their deaths. But since you, returning quickly from the Polish wars, and you from England, have arrived, order these bodies to be displayed on a platform, so I can tell the uninformed world how this happened. You will hear of lustful, violent, and monstrous acts; of unintentional decisions, chance killings; of deaths caused by trickery and coercion; and, in the end, of plans gone wrong that backfired on those who made them. I can truthfully explain all of this.

Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.	Let's hurry to hear it, and gather the most important people to listen. As for me, I sadly accept my destiny: I have claims based on past events in this country, and now is the opportune moment to assert them.

Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more: But let this same be presently perform’d, Even while men’s minds are wild; lest more mischance, On plots and errors, happen.	I’ll have reason to talk about that too, and I’ll get more information from the person who told me this. But let’s do this immediately, while everyone is still upset; otherwise, more trouble might happen because of schemes and mistakes.

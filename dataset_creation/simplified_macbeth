FIRST WITCH: When shall we three meet again In thunder, lightning, or in rain? [[When will the three of us meet again, whether it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?]]

SECOND WITCH: When the hurlyburly's done, When the battle's lost and won. [[When the chaos of the battle is over, regardless of who wins or loses.]]

THIRD WITCH: That will be ere the set of sun. [[That will happen before sunset.]]

FIRST WITCH: Where the place? [[Where should we meet?]]

SECOND WITCH: Upon the heath. [[On the open field.]]

THIRD WITCH: There to meet with Macbeth. [[We will meet Macbeth there.]]

FIRST WITCH: I come, Graymalkin! [[My cat familiar is calling, I'm coming!]]

SECOND WITCH: Paddock calls. [[My toad familiar is calling.]]

THIRD WITCH: Anon. [[Soon.]]

ALL: Fair is foul, and foul is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air. [[What seems good is bad, and what seems bad is good; let us fly through the fog and dirty air.]]

DUNCAN: What bloody man is that? He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state. [[Who is that wounded man? Judging by his condition, he can give us the latest update on the rebellion.]]

MALCOLM: This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend! Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it. [[This is the sergeant who fought bravely to keep me from being captured. Greetings, brave friend! Tell the King what you know of the battle from when you left.]]

SERGEANT: Doubtful it stood; As two spent swimmers, that do cling together And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald— Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him—from the western isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied; And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling, Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak: For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name— Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel, Which smoked with bloody execution, Like valour's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave; [[The battle was undecided, like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and hindering their ability to swim. The merciless Macdonwald – a man worthy of being a rebel because every kind of villainy seems to gather around him—was supported by soldiers from the Western Isles; and Fortune seemed to favor his wicked cause like a prostitute supporting a rebel, but it wasn't enough. Brave Macbeth – and he deserves to be called brave – scorning Fortune and wielding his sword, which was smoking from the bloody work it was doing, like valor's favorite, cleared a path until he faced that villain.]]

SERGEANT: Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps, And fix'd his head upon our battlements. [[Macbeth didn't shake his hand or say goodbye to him, but split him open from his navel to his jaws and put his head on our castle walls.]]

DUNCAN: O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman! [[Oh, brave relative! A worthy man!]]

SERGEANT: As whence the sun 'gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had with valour arm'd Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault. [[Just as terrible storms and thunder come from the east where the sun rises, so discomfort follows from where comfort should come. Listen, King of Scotland, listen: No sooner had justice, helped by courage, forced these lightly armed soldiers to flee, than the Norwegian king, seeing an opportunity, with polished weapons and fresh troops, began a new attack.]]

DUNCAN: Dismay'd not this Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? [[Didn't this dishearten our generals, Macbeth and Banquo?]]

SERGEANT: Yes; As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe: Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorise another Golgotha, I cannot tell. But I am faint, my gashes cry for help. [[Yes, about as much as eagles are afraid of sparrows or lions of hares. If I am telling the truth, I must say they fought like cannons overloaded with gunpowder, doubling and redoubling their attacks on the enemy. It was like they meant to bathe in blood or create a second place of skulls. I can't say more, but I am faint, and my wounds are crying out for help.]]

DUNCAN: So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. [[Your words are as impressive as your wounds; both speak of honor. Take him to the surgeons.]]

MALCOLM: The worthy thane of Ross. [[That's the worthy Thane of Ross.]]

LENNOX: What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look That seems to speak things strange. [[He looks very hurried and eager! He looks like he is about to tell something of great importance.]]

ROSS: God save the king! [[God save the king!]]

DUNCAN: Whence camest thou, worthy thane? [[Where have you come from, worthy Thane?]]

ROSS: From Fife, great king; Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, With terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm. Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us. [[From Fife, great king, where the Norwegian flags mock our skies and chill our people. The King of Norway himself, with overwhelming numbers, assisted by the disloyal Thane of Cawdor, started a terrible war. But Bellona's bridegroom, armored for battle, met him with equal force, rebellious point against point, arm against arm, curbing the Norwegian's excessive aggression, and finally, we won the victory.]]

DUNCAN: Great happiness! [[Great happiness!]]

ROSS: That now Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition: Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. [[Now Sweno, the Norwegian king, asks for a truce; and we refused to bury his men until he paid ten thousand dollars for our war expenses at Saint Colme's Inch.]]

DUNCAN: No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth. [[The Thane of Cawdor will no longer betray our trust. Go announce his immediate execution, and greet Macbeth with Cawdor's title.]]

ROSS: I'll see it done. [[I'll make sure it's done.]]

DUNCAN: What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. [[What the old Thane of Cawdor has lost, the noble Macbeth has now won.]]

FIRST WITCH: Where hast thou been, sister? [[Where have you been, sister?]]

SECOND WITCH: Killing swine. [[Killing pigs.]]

THIRD WITCH: Sister, where thou? [[Sister, where have you been?]]

FIRST WITCH: A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:— 'Give me,' quoth I: 'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries. Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger: But in a sieve I'll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do. [[A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and was eating them. I said, "Give me some," and the fat, ugly woman cried, "Get away from me, witch!" Her husband is gone to Aleppo, captain of the ship Tiger. But I will sail there in a sieve and, like a tailless rat, I will make her suffer.]]

SECOND WITCH: I'll give thee a wind. [[I will provide you with wind.]]

FIRST WITCH: Thou'rt kind. [[You're kind.]]

THIRD WITCH: And I another. [[And I'll give you another.]]

FIRST WITCH: I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow, All the quarters that they know I' the shipman's card. I will drain him dry as hay: Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent-house lid; He shall live a man forbid: Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle, peak and pine: Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest-tost. Look what I have. [[I have all the other winds and know all the directions they blow from, as marked on the sailor's compass. I will drain the sailor dry of life. He will never sleep, day or night. He will be an outcast, and for sixty-three weeks he will weaken, decline, and waste away. His ship won't sink, but it will be tossed about in storms. Look what I have.]]

SECOND WITCH: Show me, show me. [[Show me, show me.]]

FIRST WITCH: Here I have a pilot's thumb, Wreck'd as homeward he did come. [[Here I have a pilot's thumb, from a shipwrecked man who was coming home.]]

THIRD WITCH: A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come. [[A drum, a drum! Macbeth is coming.]]

ALL: The weird sisters, hand in hand, Posters of the sea and land, Thus do go about, about: Thrice to thine and thrice to mine And thrice again, to make up nine. Peace! the charm's wound up. [[The witches, holding hands, travel over the sea and land, going around and around: three times for me, three times for you, and three times again to make nine. Silence! The spell is complete.]]

MACBETH: So foul and fair a day I have not seen. [[I have never seen a day that was so bad and so good at the same time.]]

BANQUO: How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these So wither'd and so wild in their attire, That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at once her chappy finger laying Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so. [[How far is it to Forres? What are these creatures, so withered and wild in their appearance, who do not look like they belong on this earth, but are still here? Are you alive? Or are you something that a man can ask questions of? You seem to understand me, as you all put your chapped fingers to your lips at once. You ought to be women, but your beards make it hard to believe.]]

MACBETH: Speak, if you can: what are you? [[Speak, if you can: what are you?]]

FIRST WITCH: All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis! [[Greetings, Macbeth! Greetings to you, Thane of Glamis!]]

SECOND WITCH: All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! [[Greetings, Macbeth! Greetings to you, Thane of Cawdor!]]

THIRD WITCH: All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter! [[Greetings, Macbeth! Greetings to you, who will be king in the future!]]

BANQUO: Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate. [[Good sir, why do you jump and seem afraid of things that sound so promising? In truth, are you supernatural, or do you actually look like you do? You greet my noble companion with present honors and the prophecy of future greatness and royal expectations, so that he seems stunned by it. You say nothing to me. If you can see into the future and tell which seeds will grow and which will not, speak to me then, because I neither ask for nor fear your help or your hatred.]]

FIRST WITCH: Hail! [[Greetings!]]

SECOND WITCH: Hail! [[Greetings!]]

THIRD WITCH: Hail! [[Greetings!]]

FIRST WITCH: Lesser than Macbeth, and greater. [[You will be less important than Macbeth, but greater in another way.]]

SECOND WITCH: Not so happy, yet much happier. [[Not as fortunate, but much more fortunate.]]

THIRD WITCH: Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! [[You will be the father of kings, even though you will not be one yourself. Greetings, Macbeth and Banquo!]]

FIRST WITCH: Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! [[Banquo and Macbeth, greetings!]]

MACBETH: Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more: By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you. [[Stay, you vague speakers, tell me more. I know I am the Thane of Glamis because of my father's death; but how can I be the Thane of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor is alive, a successful man, and becoming king is impossible, as is becoming the Thane of Cawdor. Tell me, where did you get this strange information? Why do you stop us on this desolate field with such prophetic greetings? Speak, I command you!]]

BANQUO: The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd? [[The earth has strange things, just like the water; they were among them. Where have they disappeared to?]]

MACBETH: Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd! [[Into the air. What seemed like real bodies melted away like breath into the wind. I wish they had stayed!]]

BANQUO: Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner? [[Did we really see what we just spoke about, or have we eaten some kind of hallucinogenic root that has taken our reason hostage?]]

MACBETH: Your children shall be kings. [[Your children will be kings.]]

BANQUO: You shall be king. [[You will be king.]]

MACBETH: And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? [[And Thane of Cawdor, also: didn't they say that?]]

BANQUO: To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here? [[Yes, the same tune and words. Who's coming?]]

ROSS: The king hath happily received, Macbeth, The news of thy success; and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his: silenced with that, In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death. As thick as hail Came post with post; and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence, And pour'd them down before him. [[Macbeth, the king was very happy to receive news of your success. And when he read about your personal bravery in the fight against the rebels, he couldn't decide whether your bravery or his gratitude was greater. Then, looking at the rest of the news from the same day, he found you in the strong Norwegian lines, fearless of all the deadly things you had created. Messengers came one after the other, each bearing praises for your great defense of the kingdom and bringing them to the king.]]

ANGUS: We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee. [[We were sent to give you thanks from our royal king, only to announce your arrival to him, not to pay you properly.]]

ROSS: And, for an earnest of a greater honour, He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: In which addition, hail, most worthy thane! For it is thine. [[And as a promise of greater honor, he told me to call you Thane of Cawdor. So, greetings, most worthy Thane! Because the title is yours.]]

BANQUO: What, can the devil speak true? [[What? Can the devil tell the truth?]]

MACBETH: The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me In borrow'd robes? [[The Thane of Cawdor is still alive. Why are you giving me a title that isn't mine?]]

ANGUS: Who was the thane lives yet; But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not; But treasons capital, confess'd and proved, Have overthrown him. [[The former Thane is still alive, but is under a heavy sentence because he deserves to lose his life. Whether he joined forces with the Norwegians, or secretly helped the rebels, or helped to destroy his country in both ways, I don't know; but he has been overthrown because of high treason, which he confessed to and was proven guilty of.]]

MACBETH: [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor! The greatest is behind. Thanks for your pains. Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them? [[I'm Glamis and now Thane of Cawdor! The greatest title is still to come. Thank you for your hard work. Don't you hope your children will be kings, since those who made me Thane of Cawdor promised them no less?]]

BANQUO: That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange: And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths, Win us with honest trifles, to betray's In deepest consequence. Cousins, a word, I pray you. [[Believing those promises completely might tempt you to try for the crown, as well as for the title of Thane of Cawdor. But it is strange. Often, to trick us into hurting ourselves, the agents of evil tell us some truths, tempt us with unimportant prizes, in order to betray us when it really matters. Relatives, I want to talk to you both for a moment.]]

MACBETH: [Aside] Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen. Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor: If good, why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use of nature? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings: My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical, Shakes so my single state of man that function Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is But what is not. [[Two things the witches said have come true, like a happy introduction to a great play about becoming emperor. –I thank you, gentlemen. This can't be bad, and it can't be good. If it was bad, why has it given me the prize of success by telling me the truth? I am now Thane of Cawdor. If it is good, why am I giving in to this idea that makes my hair stand on end and makes my heart pound so hard it hurts, against the laws of nature? What I fear now is nothing compared to what I imagine. The thought of murder, which is only a fantasy, shakes me so hard that my ability to act is choked by guessing and imagining, and nothing seems real but what isn't.]]

BANQUO: Look, how our partner's rapt. [[Look, how lost in thought Macbeth is.]]

MACBETH: If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, Without my stir. [[If fate wants me to be king, then maybe fate will crown me without me having to do anything.]]

BANQUO: New horrors come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use. [[New thoughts come to him strangely, like new clothes that don't fit until they are worn for a while.]]

MACBETH: Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. [[No matter what happens, time passes even on the worst day.]]

BANQUO: Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. [[Worthy Macbeth, we are waiting for you to be ready to go.]]

MACBETH: Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains Are register'd where every day I turn The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king. Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time, The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak Our free hearts each to other. [[Forgive me. My mind was troubled by things I had forgotten. Kind gentlemen, I will always remember your efforts. Let's go to the king. Think about what has happened, and when we have had more time to consider it, let's talk openly with each other.]]

BANQUO: Very gladly. [[Very gladly.]]

MACBETH: Till then, enough. Come, friends. [[Until then, that's all. Come, friends.]]

DUNCAN: Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not Those in commission yet return'd? [[Has Cawdor been executed? Haven't the people who were supposed to witness it returned yet?]]

MALCOLM: My liege, They are not yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die: who did report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons, Implored your highness' pardon and set forth A deep repentance: nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it; he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed, As 'twere a careless trifle. [[My lord, they have not yet returned. But I spoke with someone who saw him die, and he said that Cawdor confessed to his treasons openly, begged for your forgiveness, and showed deep remorse. Nothing in his life looked as good on him as the way he left it; he died like someone who had practiced how to die to throw away the most valuable thing he possessed (his life), as if it were nothing.]]

DUNCAN: There's no art To find the mind's construction in the face: He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust. O worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me: thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved, That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine! only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay. [[There's no way to know what someone is thinking just by looking at their face. He was a man I trusted completely. Oh, most worthy relative! I was feeling guilty for not appreciating you enough. You are so far ahead that even the fastest reward cannot catch up with you. I wish you had done less so that I could give thanks and rewards equal to your deeds! All I can say is, you deserve more than I can ever repay.]]

MACBETH: The service and the loyalty I owe, In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part Is to receive our duties; and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants, Which do but what they should, by doing every thing Safe toward your love and honour. [[The service and loyalty I owe you is its own reward. Your job, Your Highness, is to receive our loyalty, and we are just like children and servants of your throne and your kingdom, only doing what we should by protecting your love and honor.]]

DUNCAN: Welcome hither: I have begun to plant thee, and will labour To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserved, nor must be known No less to have done so, let me enfold thee And hold thee to my heart. [[Welcome here. I have begun to make you prosper, and I will work hard to make you grow even more. Noble Banquo, you have earned just as much praise as Macbeth, and you must be known to have done so. Let me embrace you and hold you close to my heart.]]

BANQUO: There if I grow, The harvest is your own. [[If I prosper from your embrace, then all the credit will go to you.]]

DUNCAN: My plenteous joys, Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must Not unaccompanied invest him only, But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine On all deservers. From hence to Inverness, And bind us further to you. [[My abundant happiness, overflowing, seeks to hide itself in tears of joy. Sons, relatives, thanes, and all of you closest to me, know that I will establish my kingdom by naming my oldest son, Malcolm, as the Prince of Cumberland. This honor will not only belong to him, but signs of nobility, like stars, will shine on all who deserve them. From here, we will go to Inverness to further honor you.]]

MACBETH: The rest is labour, which is not used for you: I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach; So humbly take my leave. [[Any effort I make for you is not a burden: I will go ahead to announce your coming and make my wife happy with your arrival. So, I humbly take my leave.]]

DUNCAN: My worthy Cawdor! [[My worthy Thane of Cawdor!]]

MACBETH: [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires: The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be, Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. [[The Prince of Cumberland! That is an obstacle that I must either give up or jump over, because it stands in my way. Stars, hide your light; don't let anyone see my dark and secret desires. Let my eyes not see what my hands do, even if it's something I fear to look at after it's done.]]

DUNCAN: True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant, And in his commendations I am fed; It is a banquet to me. Let's after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome: It is a peerless kinsman. [[True, worthy Banquo; he is very brave, and I enjoy hearing him praised; it delights me. Let's follow Macbeth, who has gone ahead to welcome us: he is a matchless relative.]]

LADY MACBETH: 'They met me in the day of success: and I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.' Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o' the milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great; Art not without ambition, but without The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis, That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it; And that which rather thou dost fear to do Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear; And chastise with the valour of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round, [[They met me on a day when I was successful, and I learned, from the best reports, that they know more than mortals should. I was eager to ask them more questions, but they disappeared into thin air. While I was standing there amazed, messengers came from the king, greeting me as "Thane of Cawdor," the same title the witches had called me before, and referred me to a future time when I would be king. I thought I should tell you this, my dearest partner in greatness, so you wouldn't miss out on rejoicing in the greatness promised to you. Remember it and farewell.' You are already Glamis and Cawdor, and you will become what you were promised. But I fear you are too kind to do what needs to be done. You want to be great, and you are ambitious, but you don't have the ruthlessness that you need. You want to get to the top in a moral way; you won't cheat, but you'll happily take what you don't deserve. You want to be king, but you are afraid to do the thing that it takes to become it. Hurry home so I can persuade you, and push you to be more ambitious!]]

LADY MACBETH: Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crown'd withal. What is your tidings? [[Which fate and supernatural forces seem to want you to have. What news do you bring?]]

MESSENGER: The king comes here to-night. [[The king is coming here tonight.]]

LADY MACBETH: Thou'rt mad to say it: Is not thy master with him? who, were't so, Would have inform'd for preparation. [[You're crazy to say that. Isn't your master with him? If he were, he would have sent word ahead so we could prepare.]]

MESSENGER: So please you, it is true: our thane is coming: One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message. [[Believe me, it is true. Our Thane is on his way; one of my fellow servants got ahead of him, and he was so out of breath that he could barely deliver his message.]]

LADY MACBETH: Give him tending; He brings great news. The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements. Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood; Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark, To cry 'Hold, hold!' [[Take care of him; he brings great news. Even the raven that announces Duncan's death is hoarse from croaking about it. Come, you spirits who attend to human thoughts, take away my femininity and fill me completely with the most terrible cruelty! Thicken my blood, block the way for any remorse, so that no feelings of guilt can shake my cruel purpose or stop me from doing it! Come to my breasts and take my milk and replace it with poison, you murdering servants, wherever you are waiting in the invisible world for nature to go wrong! Come, thick night, and cover yourself in the darkest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife cannot see the wound it makes, and heaven cannot peek through the darkness to cry, "Stop, stop!"]]

LADY MACBETH: Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor! Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter! Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant. [[Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor! And even greater than both, because you will be king! Your letters have taken me out of this dull present, and I feel the future now.]]

MACBETH: My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night. [[My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.]]

LADY MACBETH: And when goes hence? [[And when is he leaving?]]

MACBETH: To-morrow, as he purposes. [[Tomorrow, that's his plan.]]

LADY MACBETH: O, never Shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To beguile the time, Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under't. He that's coming Must be provided for: and you shall put This night's great business into my dispatch; Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. [[Oh, that sun will never rise again! Your face, my husband, is like a book in which people can read strange things. To deceive them, look like everyone else; show welcome in your eyes, hands, and words. Look like an innocent flower, but be a snake hidden underneath it. The man who's coming must be taken care of, and you will leave the plan to me. Doing this will give us absolute power over all our future days and nights.]]

MACBETH: We will speak further. [[We'll talk more about this.]]

LADY MACBETH: Only look up clear; To alter favour ever is to fear: Leave all the rest to me. [[Just look happy and confident. To look worried is a sign of fear. Leave everything else to me.]]

DUNCAN: This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. [[This castle has a pleasant location; the air seems to gently and sweetly please our senses.]]

BANQUO: This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle: Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate. [[This summer visitor, the martin that nests in churches, shows by his choice of a home that the air here smells delightful. There is no projection, carving, or corner that this bird hasn't used to build its hanging nest and cradle. Where they nest the most, I have observed, the air is clean and sweet.]]

DUNCAN: See, see, our honour'd hostess! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble. [[Look, look, our honored hostess! The love that follows us can be a burden, but we still thank them for it as love. Here, I will show you how you should pray to God to reward those who serve us, and thank them for the trouble they have gone to.]]

LADY MACBETH: All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honours deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house: for those of old, And the late dignities heap'd up to them, We rest your hermits. [[All the service we could do, even done twice and then twice over, would be small in comparison to the great honors that Your Majesty bestows on our house: for those past honors and the recent ones, we are your humble servants.]]

DUNCAN: Where's the thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose To be his purveyor: but he rides well; And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest to-night. [[Where is the Thane of Cawdor? We followed closely behind him and planned to announce our arrival, but he rides well, and his great love, sharp as his spurs, has helped him to get home before us. Fair and noble hostess, we are your guest tonight.]]

LADY MACBETH: Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own. [[Your servants always consider their possessions, their own selves, and everything they have as things that are always available, and to be used as you wish.]]

DUNCAN: Give me your hand; Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly, And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess. [[Give me your hand; lead me to Macbeth. We love him a lot, and will continue to give him honors. With your permission, hostess.]]

MACBETH: If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly: if the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgment here; that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips. He's here in double trust; First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity, like a naked new-born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other. [[If the act could be finished as soon as it's started, it would be ideal. If the assassination could trap all the consequences and bring success with his death, if this murder could be the be-all and end-all of the matter, then I'd happily risk my afterlife, but we still have to face the earthly judgement. By teaching violence, we are only teaching others to inflict it on ourselves. Equal justice demands that the poison we prepare will be drunk by us. He trusts me in two ways: first, as his relative and his subject, both of which should prevent me from harming him; second, as his host, who should lock the door against his murderers, not be one myself. Besides, Duncan has been a humble king, he has acted clearly in his office, and his virtues will speak like angels, loud and clear, against the damnation of his murder. And pity, like a helpless newborn baby or heaven's angels riding the wind, will spread the horror of the deed to everyone, so that tears will drown the wind. I have no reason to go through with it except for my own ambition, which makes me rush ahead too fast and fall on the other side.]]

LADY MACBETH: He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber? [[He has almost finished supper. Why did you leave the dining room?]]

MACBETH: Hath he ask'd for me? [[Has he asked about me?]]

LADY MACBETH: Know you not he has? [[Don't you know that he has?]]

MACBETH: We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon. [[We will not continue with this plan. He has honored me recently, and I have earned the respect of all kinds of people, which I want to enjoy now, not throw away so soon.]]

LADY MACBETH: Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,' Like the poor cat i' the adage? [[Were you drunk when you felt that hope? Has it slept since, and now it wakes up and looks sick at what it did so freely? From now on, that's how I will see your love. Are you afraid to be as brave in action as you are in desire? Do you want what you think is the most valuable thing in life, but live as a coward in your own eyes, letting "I dare not" always follow "I want to," like the cat in the old story?]]

MACBETH: Prithee, peace: I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none. [[Please, stop. I dare do anything that is worthy of a man; whoever does more is not a man at all.]]

LADY MACBETH: What beast was't, then, That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And, to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both: They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me: I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums, And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this. [[What kind of animal were you, then, that made you tell me about this plan? When you dared to do it, then you were a man; and to become greater than you were, you wanted to be even more of a man. There was no right time or place then, and yet you were determined to make them. Now the opportunity is here and you are backing down. I have breastfed a baby, and I know how tender it is to love the child that nurses at my breast. But I would have ripped my nipple from his gums while he was smiling in my face and smashed his brains out, if I had sworn to do it as you have sworn to this.]]

MACBETH: If we should fail? [[What if we fail?]]

LADY MACBETH: We fail! But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep— Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell? [[Fail? No, if you just get your courage screwed up tight, we won't fail. When Duncan is asleep, which he will be, because of his hard day, I will get his two guards so drunk that their memories will fade away, and they will only be able to dimly understand what is happening around them. When they are lying there, completely drunk and like they are dead, what can't you and I do to the unguarded Duncan? What can't we blame on those guards, who will be so drunk they'll be unable to speak?]]

MACBETH: Bring forth men-children only; For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males. Will it not be received, When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done't? [[You should only have male children, because your strength and bravery should only produce sons. Won't people believe us when we smear those two guards in his room with blood and use their own daggers, that they are the ones who did it?]]

LADY MACBETH: Who dares receive it other, As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar Upon his death? [[Who would dare believe anything else, after we express our grief so loudly when he dies?]]

MACBETH: I am settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show: False face must hide what the false heart doth know. [[I am determined, and I will use every part of my body to perform this terrible deed. Let's go, and deceive everyone with a happy appearance. A false face must hide what the false heart knows.]]

BANQUO: How goes the night, boy? [[What time is it, boy?]]

FLEANCE: The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. [[The moon has set; I haven't heard the clock strike.]]

BANQUO: And she goes down at twelve. [[And the moon sets at twelve.]]

FLEANCE: I take't, 'tis later, sir. [[Then it must be later, sir.]]

BANQUO: Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out. Take thee that too. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose! [[Here, take my sword. The heavens are being economical; all the stars are out. Take my dagger, too. I feel very tired, but I don't want to sleep. Merciful gods, keep me from the evil thoughts that come in sleep!]]

MACBETH: Give me my sword. Who's there? [[Give me my sword. Who's there?]]

BANQUO: A friend. [[It's a friend.]]

BANQUO: What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed: He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up In measureless content. [[What, sir, not in bed yet? The king had an especially great time tonight and sent generous gifts to the servants. He sent this diamond to your wife, calling her the kindest of hostesses, and has gone to bed very pleased.]]

MACBETH: Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect; Which else should free have wrought. [[Because we were not prepared, our desire to serve the king was limited. Otherwise, we would have done even more.]]

BANQUO: All's well. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have show'd some truth. [[Everything is good. Last night I dreamed about the three witches: they seem to have told you some truths.]]

MACBETH: I think not of them: Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time. [[I don't think about them, but if we can find some free time, we can talk about it, if you'd be willing to do that.]]

BANQUO: At your kind'st leisure. [[Whenever it's convenient for you.]]

MACBETH: If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis, It shall make honour for you. [[If you stick with me when the time comes, it will bring honor to you.]]

BANQUO: So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counsell'd. [[As long as I don't lose any honor in trying to gain more, and as long as my conscience and loyalty are clear, I will follow your advice.]]

MACBETH: Good repose the while! [[Good night!]]

BANQUO: Thanks, sir: the like to you! [[Thanks, sir: and the same to you.]]

MACBETH: Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going; And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. There's no such thing: It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder, Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace. With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives: Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. [[Go tell your mistress to ring the bell when my drink is ready. Get to bed. Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with the handle facing my hand? Let me grab it. I can't touch it, but I can still see it. Are you a real vision that I can feel as well as see, or are you just a hallucination, created by my fevered brain? I can still see you, as real as the dagger I am drawing now. You are leading me toward the way I was going, and it's just the kind of weapon I was going to use. My eyes are either deceiving my other senses, or they are better than all the others put together. I can still see the dagger, and there are drops of blood on the blade and the hilt that weren't there before. No, there's no dagger, it's the bloody deed that makes me see it. Now over half the world nature seems dead, and evil dreams disturb people's sleep; witches worship pale Hecate, and withered Murder, warned by his guard, the wolf, with his stealthy pace moves toward his goal like a ghost with Tarquin's predatory steps. Firm earth, don't listen to my footsteps, so that the stones will not reveal my presence, and ruin the horror of this moment. While I am talking, Duncan is still alive; talking makes the deed seem less urgent.]]

MACBETH: I go, and it is done; the bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell. [[I am going to do it; the bell invites me. Don't hear it, Duncan, because it's a death knell that calls you to heaven or hell.]]

LADY MACBETH: That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold; What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it: The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die. [[What has made them drunk has given me courage. What has put them out has ignited a fire in me. Listen! Silence! That was the shriek of the owl, the fatal bellman who calls out a final farewell. He is doing it. The doors are open, and the drunken guards are ignoring their duty and snoring. I drugged their drinks so that death and nature are fighting over them, not knowing whether they will live or die.]]

LADY MACBETH: Alack, I am afraid they have awaked, And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done't. My husband! [[Oh no, I am afraid they have awakened, and he hasn't done it yet. Trying and failing would ruin us. Listen! I left their daggers ready, he couldn't have missed them. If he hadn't looked like my father when he slept, I would have done it myself. My husband!]]

MACBETH: I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? [[I have killed Duncan. Didn't you hear a noise?]]

LADY MACBETH: I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak? [[I heard the owl scream and the crickets chirp. Didn't you say something?]]

MACBETH: When? [[When?]]

LADY MACBETH: Now. [[Now.]]

MACBETH: As I descended? [[When I was coming down from killing him?]]

LADY MACBETH: Ay. [[Yes.]]

MACBETH: Hark! Who lies i' the second chamber? [[Listen! Who is sleeping in the next room?]]

LADY MACBETH: Donalbain. [[Donalbain.]]

MACBETH: This is a sorry sight. [[This is a terrible sight.]]

LADY MACBETH: A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. [[It's foolish to say it's a terrible sight.]]

MACBETH: There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!' That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them: But they did say their prayers, and address'd them Again to sleep. [[One of them laughed in his sleep, and the other cried, "Murder!" They woke each other up. I stood there and heard them, but they said their prayers and went back to sleep.]]

LADY MACBETH: There are two lodged together. [[There are two of them sleeping in the same room.]]

MACBETH: One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other; As they had seen me with these hangman's hands. Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,' When they did say 'God bless us!' [[One of them cried, "God bless us!" and the other said, "Amen," as if they had seen me with these killer's hands. Listening to their fear, I couldn't say "Amen" when they said, "God bless us!"

LADY MACBETH: Consider it not so deeply. [[Don't think about it so much.]]

MACBETH: But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'? I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' Stuck in my throat. [[But why couldn't I say "Amen?" I needed God's blessing more than ever, but "Amen" stuck in my throat.]]

LADY MACBETH: These deeds must not be thought After these ways; so, it will make us mad. [[You can't think about these things so deeply, or it will drive us crazy.]]

MACBETH: Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care, The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast,— [[I thought I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more! Macbeth has murdered sleep," innocent sleep, the sleep that repairs the tangled threads of worry, the death of each day's life, a bath for aching muscles, balm for troubled minds, great nature's second course, the most important thing to nourish life,]]

LADY MACBETH: What do you mean? [[What do you mean?]]

MACBETH: Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house: 'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.' [[It kept crying, "Sleep no more!" to everyone in the house: "Glamis has murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor will sleep no more; Macbeth will sleep no more."]]

LADY MACBETH: Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength, to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there: go carry them; and smear The sleepy grooms with blood. [[Who was it that cried like that? Why, worthy Thane, you're weakening your noble strength by thinking so crazily about these things. Go get some water and wash the blood off your hands. Why did you bring the daggers from the room? They need to be there. Go put them back and smear the sleeping guards with blood.]]

MACBETH: I'll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on't again I dare not. [[I will not go back in there. I am afraid to think about what I have done; I can't bear to look at it again.]]

LADY MACBETH: Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal; For it must seem their guilt. [[You are weak-willed! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead are only like pictures; it's only children who are afraid of paintings of the devil. If he is still bleeding, I will smear the guards' faces with the blood so that it will look like they are guilty.]]

MACBETH: Whence is that knocking? How is't with me, when every noise appals me? What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes. Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas in incarnadine, Making the green one red. [[Where is that knocking coming from? What's wrong with me, when every noise terrifies me? What hands are these? They are pulling out my eyes! Could all the water in the ocean wash this blood off my hands? No, my hand would sooner stain the seas red.]]

LADY MACBETH: My hands are of your colour; but I shame To wear a heart so white. I hear a knocking At the south entry: retire we to our chamber; A little water clears us of this deed: How easy is it, then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended. Hark! more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us, And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts. [[My hands are the same color as yours, but I would be ashamed to be such a coward. I hear a knocking at the south gate; let's go to our bedroom. A little water will wash away the evidence: it's that easy! You've lost your self-control. Listen! More knocking. Put on your nightgown so that we don't look like we've been awake all night. Don't get so lost in your thoughts.]]

MACBETH: To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! [[To fully realize what I've done, it would be best if I didn't know myself at all. Wake up Duncan with your knocking! I wish you could!]]

PORTER: Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key. Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat for't. Knock, knock! Who's there, in the other devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale; who committed treason enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. Knock, knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. Knock, knock; never at quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire. Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter. [[There's a lot of knocking today! If I were the gatekeeper of hell, I would be constantly turning the key. Knock, knock, knock! Who's there in the name of the devil? Here is a farmer who hanged himself because he was expecting a big harvest. You're here just in time; bring some handkerchiefs with you because you'll sweat a lot here. Knock, knock! Who's there in the devil's name? Here is a liar who could lie either way, who committed treason for God but couldn't lie his way into Heaven. Come in, you liar. Knock, knock, knock! Who's there? Here's an English tailor who came here for stealing fabric from French trousers. Come in, tailor; you can iron your clothes here. Knock, knock; never quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I don't want to be the porter for the devil anymore. I was going to let in some people from every profession that goes the easy way to hell. Coming, coming! Please, remember to tip the porter.]]

MACDUFF: Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late? [[Was it so late when you went to bed, friend, that you are still sleeping so late?]]

PORTER: 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock: and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. [[Honestly, sir, we were drinking until the second rooster crowed, and drink is a great cause of three things.]]

MACDUFF: What three things does drink especially provoke? [[What three things does drink especially cause?]]

PORTER: Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance: therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. [[Well, sir, a red nose, sleep, and urine. It encourages and discourages lechery; it encourages desire but takes away the ability to perform. So, drinking a lot can be said to be a liar when it comes to lechery: it creates him, but it ruins him; it turns him on and off; it persuades him and discourages him; it makes him stand up and then not stand up; in the end, it betrays him into sleep, and, after giving him the lie, it leaves him there.]]

MACDUFF: I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. [[I think drink betrayed you last night.]]

PORTER: That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him. [[It did, sir, right down my throat: but I got back at it for its lies. I think I was too strong for it, and even though it made me fall down sometimes, I still managed to throw it off.]]

MACDUFF: Is thy master stirring? Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes. [[Is your master up? Our knocking has woken him; here he comes.]]

LENNOX: Good morrow, noble sir. [[Good morning, noble sir.]]

MACBETH: Good morrow, both. [[Good morning to both of you.]]

MACDUFF: Is the king stirring, worthy thane? [[Is the king awake, worthy Thane?]]

MACBETH: Not yet. [[Not yet.]]

MACDUFF: He did command me to call timely on him: I have almost slipp'd the hour. [[He ordered me to come and wake him early; I'm almost late.]]

MACBETH: I'll bring you to him. [[I'll take you to him.]]

MACDUFF: I know this is a joyful trouble to you; But yet 'tis one. [[I know it must be a burden, even if a welcome one.]]

MACBETH: The labour we delight in physics pain. This is the door. [[The work we enjoy makes the pain disappear. This is the door.]]

MACDUFF: I'll make so bold to call, For 'tis my limited service. [[I will take the liberty of knocking, as it is my sworn duty.]]

LENNOX: Goes the king hence to-day? [[Is the king leaving today?]]

MACBETH: He does: he did appoint so. [[He is; he planned to.]]

LENNOX: The night has been unruly: where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say, Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death, And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth Was feverous and did shake. [[The night has been turbulent: where we were sleeping, our chimneys were blown down. They say lamentations were heard in the air, strange screams of death, and terrible prophecies of fire and chaos for these awful times. The owl hooted all night long; some say the earth was feverish and shaking.]]

MACBETH: 'Twas a rough night. [[It was a rough night.]]

LENNOX: My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it. [[I can't remember a night like it.]]

MACDUFF: O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart Cannot conceive nor name thee! [[Oh, horror, horror, horror! No one can imagine or name what happened!]]

MACBETH, LENNOX: What's the matter. [[What's the matter?]]

MACDUFF: Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence The life o' the building! [[Chaos has now created its masterpiece! Sacrilegious murder has broken into the Lord's holy temple and stolen the life of that building!]]

MACBETH: What is 't you say? the life? [[What are you saying? His life?]]

LENNOX: Mean you his majesty? [[Do you mean the King?]]

MACDUFF: Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak; See, and then speak yourselves. Awake, awake! Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake! Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, And look on death itself! up, up, and see The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo! As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror! Ring the bell. [[Go to his room and let your eyes be destroyed by a new Gorgon (something horrible to look at). Don't make me tell you what happened, see it for yourselves and then speak. Awake, awake! Ring the alarm bell! Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! Awake! Shake off this sleep, which is just a pale imitation of death, and look at death itself! Get up and see a picture of the end of the world! Malcolm! Banquo! Rise from your beds and walk like ghosts to show what a horror this is! Ring the bell!]]

LADY MACBETH: What's the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house? speak, speak! [[What is happening that such a horrible alarm is waking everyone in the house? Tell me, tell me!]]

MACDUFF: O gentle lady, 'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman's ear, Would murder as it fell. O Banquo, Banquo, Our royal master 's murder'd! [[Oh, gentle lady, you shouldn't hear what I have to say. Just hearing the news would kill a woman. Oh Banquo, Banquo, our King has been murdered!]]

LADY MACBETH: Woe, alas! What, in our house? [[Oh no! What, in our house?]]

BANQUO: Too cruel any where. Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so. [[That's too horrible anywhere. Dear Macduff, please tell me that you are lying and that it isn't true.]]

MACBETH: Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant, There 's nothing serious in mortality: All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of. [[If I had died an hour before this happened, I would have lived a blessed life, because from now on, nothing serious is left in this life; everything is meaningless. Fame and honor are dead; the wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs are left in this world to brag about.]]

DONALBAIN: What is amiss? [[What's wrong?]]

MACBETH: You are, and do not know't: The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd. [[You are in danger, and you don't know it. The source of your life, the king, is gone, and the well has run dry.]]

MACDUFF: Your royal father 's murder'd. [[Your royal father has been murdered.]]

MALCOLM: O, by whom? [[Oh, by whom?]]

LENNOX: Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't: Their hands and faces were an badged with blood; So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows: They stared, and were distracted; no man's life Was to be trusted with them. [[It looks like his guards did it. Their hands and faces were covered with blood, and we found their bloody daggers beside them on their pillows. They were staring and seemed crazy; no one could trust them.]]

MACBETH: O, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them. [[Oh, I regret my anger that made me kill them!]]

MACDUFF: Wherefore did you so? [[Why did you do that?]]

MACBETH: Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man: The expedition my violent love Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood; And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make 's love kno wn? [[How can a man be wise, shocked, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral at the same time? No one can. My love was so strong that it overpowered my reason. There lay Duncan, his silver skin covered in his golden blood; his stab wounds looked like a tear in nature, allowing ruin to enter. There were the murderers, covered in the blood of their crime, their daggers disgustingly coated in blood; who could stop himself, who had a heart full of love, and courage to express that love?]]

LADY MACBETH: Help me hence, ho! [[Help me, someone!]]

MACDUFF: Look to the lady. [[Take care of the lady.]]

MALCOLM: [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues, That most may claim this argument for ours? [[Why are we keeping quiet, when we have the most reason to speak?]]

DONALBAIN: [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us? Let 's away; Our tears are not yet brew'd. [[What can we say here, where our fate, hidden in a tiny hole, may rush out and grab us? Let's get out of here; we haven't even begun to cry yet.]]

MALCOLM: Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion. [[Nor has our strong sorrow even begun to move us to action yet.]]

BANQUO: Look to the lady. And when we have our naked frailties hid, That suffer in exposure, let us meet, And question this most bloody piece of work, To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us: In the great hand of God I stand; and thence Against the undivulged pretence I fight Of treasonous malice. [[Take care of the lady. Once we have put on our clothes, which we shouldn't be without, let's meet and investigate this bloody crime so that we can understand it better. Fears and doubts are shaking us. I put myself in God's hands and will fight against any hidden treasonous malice.]]

MACDUFF: And so do I. [[And so do I.]]

ALL: So all. [[So say we all.]]

MACBETH: Let's briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i' the hall together. [[Let's get dressed quickly and meet in the hall.]]

ALL: Well contented. [[Agreed.]]

MALCOLM: What will you do? Let's not consort with them: To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy. I'll to England. [[What are you going to do? Let's not stay with them; it's easy for a liar to pretend to be sorry. I'm going to England.]]

DONALBAIN: To Ireland, I; our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer: where we are, There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood, The nearer bloody. [[I'll go to Ireland. If we split up, we will be safer; here, everyone is smiling, but they're hiding daggers. The closer the relationship, the more likely the person is to be covered in blood.]]

MALCOLM: This murderous shaft that's shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse; And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, But shift away: there's warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left. [[This murder has happened, and we don't know what the next move will be, and we will be safest if we get out of the way. So, let's get on our horses; let's not bother with saying goodbye, but sneak away. Running away can be justified when we have no other choice.]]

OLD MAN: Threescore and ten I can remember well: Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings. [[I can remember seventy years clearly: in all that time I have seen terrible and strange things, but this awful night makes everything I knew before seem trivial.]]

ROSS: Ah, good father, Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act, Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp: Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, That darkness does the face of earth entomb, When living light should kiss it? [[Ah, good father, you see how the heavens are disturbed by man's actions and threaten the stage where blood has been spilled. According to the clock, it's daytime, and yet dark night is blocking the sun. Is it because night is stronger than day, or is it the day's shame that causes darkness to cover the earth when light should be shining on it?]]

OLD MAN: 'Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd. [[It's unnatural, just like the deed that's been committed. Last Tuesday, a falcon, soaring high in the sky, was attacked and killed by a little owl that usually hunts mice.]]

ROSS: And Duncan's horses—a thing most strange and certain— Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind. [[And Duncan's horses – this is very strange and certainly true – beautiful and swift, the best of their breed, turned wild, broke out of their stalls, and started fighting against any attempt to control them, as if they wanted to make war on mankind.]]

OLD MAN: 'Tis said they eat each other. [[It is said that they ate each other.]]

ROSS: They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff. How goes the world, sir, now? [[They did, to my amazement, as I saw with my own eyes. Here comes the good Macduff. How is the world going, sir?]]

MACDUFF: Why, see you not? [[Can't you see for yourself?]]

ROSS: Is't known who did this more than bloody deed? [[Is it known who committed this very bloody murder?]]

MACDUFF: Those that Macbeth hath slain. [[Those that Macbeth has killed did it.]]

ROSS: Alas, the day! What good could they pretend? [[Oh, no! What reason could they have had?]]

MACDUFF: They were suborn'd: Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed. [[They were bribed. Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them look like they committed the crime.]]

ROSS: 'Gainst nature still! Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. [[Still against nature! Self-destructive ambition that makes you destroy what sustains your life. Then it is very likely that the crown will go to Macbeth.]]

MACDUFF: He is already named, and gone to Scone To be invested. [[He has already been named king and has gone to Scone to be crowned.]]

ROSS: Where is Duncan's body? [[Where is Duncan's body?]]

MACDUFF: Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones. [[Carried to Iona, the sacred burial place of his ancestors, where their bones are kept.]]

ROSS: Will you to Scone? [[Will you go to Scone?]]

MACDUFF: No, cousin, I'll to Fife. [[No, cousin, I'm going to Fife.]]

ROSS: Well, I will thither. [[Well, I will go there too.]]

MACDUFF: Well, may you see things well done there: adieu! Lest our old robes sit easier than our new! [[Well, may you see good things done there: goodbye! I hope things will go better than our current situation.]]

ROSS: Farewell, father. [[Goodbye, father.]]

OLD MAN: God's benison go with you; and with those That would make good of bad, and friends of foes! [[God's blessing go with you, and with those who would try to turn bad things into good and make friends out of enemies!]]

BANQUO: Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the weird women promised, and, I fear, Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity, But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings. If there come truth from them— As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine— Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope? But hush! no more. [[You have it all now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, just like the witches promised, and I fear you cheated to get it. But they also said that the crown wouldn't stay in your family, but that I would be the ancestor of many kings. If they tell the truth—as their words about you have come true—why can't their prophecies come true for me as well and give me hope? But be quiet! I shouldn't think of this.]]

MACBETH: Here's our chief guest. [[Here is our most important guest.]]

LADY MACBETH: If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all-thing unbecoming. [[If we had forgotten him, it would have been like a missing tooth in our great feast, and it would have been inappropriate.]]

MACBETH: To-night we hold a solemn supper sir, And I'll request your presence. [[Tonight we are having a formal banquet, and I would like you to be there.]]

BANQUO: Let your highness Command upon me; to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie For ever knit. [[Your Highness can command me; my loyalty is tied to you with a bond that can never be broken.]]

MACBETH: Ride you this afternoon? [[Are you going for a ride this afternoon?]]

BANQUO: Ay, my good lord. [[Yes, my good lord.]]

MACBETH: We should have else desired your good advice, Which still hath been both grave and prosperous, In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow. Is't far you ride? [[Otherwise, I would have liked your advice, which has always been serious and successful, in today's meeting, but we'll talk tomorrow. Are you going far?]]

BANQUO: As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain. [[Only as far as will take up the time between now and supper. If my horse doesn't do well, I will have to travel into the night for an hour or two.]]

MACBETH: Fail not our feast. [[Don't miss our feast.]]

BANQUO: My lord, I will not. [[My lord, I won't.]]

MACBETH: We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd In England and in Ireland, not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention: but of that to-morrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu, Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you? [[We hear that our murderous cousins are in England and Ireland, still not admitting to killing their father, and filling their listeners with strange lies, but we'll talk about that tomorrow, when we have state business that requires our attention. Get on your horse, goodbye, until you come back tonight. Is Fleance going with you?]]

BANQUO: Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's. [[Yes, my good lord: it's time for us to go.]]

MACBETH: I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell. Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night: to make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you! Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men Our pleasure? [[I hope your horses are fast and sure-footed; and I entrust you to their care. Farewell. Everyone is free to do what they want until seven o'clock tonight. So we can enjoy each other's company more, we will stay by ourselves until supper. Until then, God be with you. You, I want to talk to you. Are those men waiting for my orders?]]

ATTENDANT: They are, my lord, without the palace gate. [[They are, my lord, outside the palace gate.]]

MACBETH: Bring them before us. To be thus is nothing; But to be safely thus.—Our fears in Banquo Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares; And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and, under him, My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said, Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me, And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like They hail'd him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so, For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come fate into the list. And champion me to the utterance! Who's there! [[Bring them in here. Being king is nothing if I am not safe. My fears about Banquo are very deep, because he has a noble nature that makes him someone to be feared. He dares to do a lot, and with that fearlessness, he has the wisdom to make sure his courage keeps him safe. He is the only one whose existence I fear; he is above me, like Caesar was above Mark Antony. He scolded the witches when they first made me king and told them to speak to him. Then, like prophets, they greeted him as the father of a line of kings. On my head, they placed a crown that means nothing, and put a scepter in my hand that will be taken from me, because none of my sons will be king after me. If that is so, then I have ruined my conscience for Banquo's descendants; I murdered the kind Duncan for them, and put poison in my peaceful mind only for them. I have given up my eternal soul to evil only to make them kings, the descendants of Banquo kings! Rather than that, let fate come and fight me to the death! Who's there!]]

MACBETH: Now go to the door, and stay there till we call. Was it not yesterday we spoke together? [[Now go to the door, and wait there until I call you. Didn't we speak together yesterday?]]

FIRST MURDERER: It was, so please your highness. [[Yes, it was, Your Highness.]]

MACBETH: Well then, now Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self: this I made good to you In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say 'Thus did Banquo.' [[Well then, have you thought about what I said? You know that Banquo has been holding you down, even though you thought it was me. I explained it to you in our last conversation, how you were manipulated, how the tools and the people who used them worked against you, and all the other things that would tell a half-wit that "Banquo did this."]]

FIRST MURDERER: You made it known to us. [[You made that clear to us.]]

MACBETH: I did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave And beggar'd yours for ever? [[I did, and I went even further, which is why we are meeting again today. Are you so patient that you can let this go? Are you such good Christians that you are going to pray for this man and his children, whose actions have ruined you and your families forever?]]

FIRST MURDERER: We are men, my liege. [[We are men, my lord.]]

MACBETH: Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept All by the name of dogs: the valued file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive Particular addition. from the bill That writes them all alike: and so of men. Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't; And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect. [[Yes, you are called men, just as all types of dogs—hounds, greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shaggy dogs, and half-wolves—are all called dogs. But we put different values on them, distinguishing between the fast, the slow, the clever, the house dog, the hunting dog, each according to the gifts that nature has given him, making him different from all the others, even though they are all called dogs. It's the same with men. So, if you consider yourselves to be above the lowest rank of men, tell me now, and I will give you the task of killing our enemy, winning my friendship and gratitude. My happiness will be perfect when he is dead.]]

SECOND MURDERER: I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world. [[I am one, my lord, who has been so angered by the blows of the world that I will do anything to spite the world.]]

FIRST MURDERER: And I another So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune, That I would set my lie on any chance, To mend it, or be rid on't. [[And I am another, so tired of the disasters and the struggles of life that I would bet my life on any chance to improve it or end it.]]

MACBETH: Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy. [[Both of you know that Banquo was your enemy.]]

BOTH MURDERERS: True, my lord. [[True, my lord.]]

MACBETH: So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life: and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down; and thence it is, That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons. [[He is my enemy, too; and his very existence is a threat to me. Although I could easily have him killed, I can't because we have friends in common whose friendship I don't want to lose. I would rather weep over his death than have people suspect me of killing him. So that's why I'm asking for your help, to keep the murder secret from everyone for several important reasons.]]

SECOND MURDERER: We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us. [[We will do whatever you order us to do, my lord.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Though our lives— [[Even if it costs us our lives—]]

MACBETH: Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves; Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, The moment on't; for't must be done to-night, And something from the palace; always thought That I require a clearness: and with him— To leave no rubs nor botches in the work— Fleance his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father's, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart: I'll come to you anon. [[Your courage shines through you. Within the hour, I will tell you where to wait and give you perfect information on the timing; it has to be done tonight, and not too far from the palace. Also, I want to make sure you understand that I need it to be done neatly. And with him, so you don't mess things up, Fleance, his son, who is always with him, and whose death is as important to me as his father's, must be killed that night as well. Think about it, and I will come see you soon.]]

BOTH MURDERERS: We are resolved, my lord. [[We are ready to do it, my lord.]]

MACBETH: I'll call upon you straight: abide within. It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight, If it find heaven, must find it out to-night. [[I will see you shortly; wait inside. It is settled. Banquo, your soul's journey to heaven will happen tonight.]]

LADY MACBETH: Is Banquo gone from court? [[Has Banquo left the palace?]]

SERVANT: Ay, madam, but returns again to-night. [[Yes, madam, but he's coming back tonight.]]

LADY MACBETH: Say to the king, I would attend his leisure For a few words. [[Tell the king I want to speak with him for a moment.]]

LADY MACBETH: Nought's had, all's spent, Where our desire is got without content: 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. How now, my lord! why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what's done is done. [[We have gained nothing; we have spent everything when we achieve our goals but are not happy. It is better to be the person who gets murdered than to live in constant fear of being found out. Why are you alone, keeping company with sad thoughts, thinking about things that should have died with the people they concern? Things that can't be changed shouldn't be thought about; what's done is done.]]

MACBETH: We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it: She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly: better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After life's fitful fever he sleeps well; Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing, Can touch him further. [[We have wounded the snake, but not killed it; it will heal and be as dangerous as before, and our evil plan is still at risk. I'd rather the universe fall apart than eat my meals in fear and suffer from these terrible nightmares that shake me every night. It's better to be dead, with the peace that we have given them, than to be tortured in my mind, unable to rest. Duncan is in his grave; his restless life is over, and he sleeps well. Treason has done its worst; nothing—neither steel nor poison, domestic treachery, nor foreign invasion—can hurt him anymore.]]

LADY MACBETH: Come on; Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night. [[Come on; gentle my lord, smooth out your worried face; be cheerful and happy with our guests tonight.]]

MACBETH: So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you: Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: Unsafe the while, that we Must lave our honours in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are. [[That's what I'll do, love, and I hope you will too. Remember to pay special attention to Banquo; show him honor in both your eyes and words. It's dangerous for us that we have to wash our honor in these lies and pretend to be something that we are not.]]

LADY MACBETH: You must leave this. [[You must stop doing this.]]

MACBETH: O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives. [[Oh, my mind is full of dangerous thoughts, dear wife! You know that Banquo and his son, Fleance, are still alive.]]

LADY MACBETH: But in them nature's copy's not eterne. [[But they will not live forever.]]

MACBETH: There's comfort yet; they are assailable; Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note. [[That's encouraging; they can be attacked. So, be cheerful! Before the bat has flown around the church and the beetle's buzzing has rung in the night, something terrible will have happened.]]

LADY MACBETH: What's to be done? [[What's to be done?]]

MACBETH: Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day; And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood: Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; While night's black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. [[Don't worry about knowing the details, my dearest, until you can celebrate it. Come, blinding night, cover the sensitive eyes of day; and with your bloody and invisible hand, destroy that promise that keeps me afraid! The light is fading, and the crow is flying to the forest. The good things of the day are starting to fade away, while night's evil servants are waking up to hunt. You are surprised by my words, but don't worry; bad things get stronger by doing more bad things. So, please, come with me.]]

FIRST MURDERER: But who did bid thee join with us? [[But who told you to join us?]]

THIRD MURDERER: Macbeth. [[Macbeth.]]

SECOND MURDERER: He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just. [[We don't need to distrust him since he is giving us our instructions and telling us what we need to do.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day: Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch. [[Then stand with us. The west is still glowing with some light from the day. Now the late traveler is hurrying to reach the inn before nightfall, and our target is approaching.]]

THIRD MURDERER: Hark! I hear horses. [[Listen! I hear horses.]]

BANQUO: Give us a light there, ho! [[Give us a light there!]]

SECOND MURDERER: Then 'tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' the court. [[Then it's him. The others that are invited to the feast are already at the palace.]]

FIRST MURDERER: His horses go about. [[His horses are going a different way.]]

THIRD MURDERER: Almost a mile: but he does usually, So all men do, from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk. [[Almost a mile; but he usually, as everyone does, walks from here to the palace gate.]]

SECOND MURDERER: A light, a light! [[A light, a light!]]

THIRD MURDERER: 'Tis he. [[It's him.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Stand to't. [[Get ready.]]

BANQUO: It will be rain to-night. [[It will rain tonight.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Let it come down. [[Let it rain.]]

BANQUO: O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! Thou mayst revenge. O slave! [[Oh, treachery! Run, good Fleance, run, run, run! You can avenge my death. Oh, you villain!]]

THIRD MURDERER: Who did strike out the light? [[Who put out the light?]]

FIRST MURDERER: Wast not the way? [[Was that the way to do it?]]

THIRD MURDERER: There's but one down; the son is fled. [[Only one is dead; the son has escaped.]]

SECOND MURDERER: We have lost Best half of our affair. [[We have lost the most important part of our task.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Well, let's away, and say how much is done. [[Well, let's go and tell him how much we did.]]

MACBETH: You know your own degrees; sit down: at first And last the hearty welcome. [[You know your proper rank; sit down. I welcome you all warmly.]]

LORDS: Thanks to your majesty. [[Thank you, Your Majesty.]]

MACBETH: Ourself will mingle with society, And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time We will require her welcome. [[I will join you all and be a humble host. Our hostess is sitting in her royal chair, but soon I will ask her to welcome you.]]

LADY MACBETH: Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; For my heart speaks they are welcome. [[Say it for me, sir, to all our friends; my heart tells me they are welcome.]]

MACBETH: See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks. Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst: Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure The table round. There's blood on thy face. [[See, they are thanking you from the bottom of their hearts. We are all equal: here I'll sit in the middle. Be merry; soon we will drink to everyone around the table. There's blood on your face.]]

FIRST MURDERER: 'Tis Banquo's then. [[Then it's Banquo's.]]

MACBETH: 'Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatch'd? [[It's better for you to have his blood on you than for him to be here alive. Is he dead?]]

FIRST MURDERER: My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him. [[My lord, his throat is cut; that's what I did to him.]]

MACBETH: Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it, Thou art the nonpareil. [[You are the best of all killers. But the one who killed Fleance would be even better; if you did that too, you're the best.]]

FIRST MURDERER: Most royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped. [[Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.]]

MACBETH: Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe? [[Then the shaking comes back: otherwise I would have been perfect, as whole as marble, as solid as rock, as free as the air. But now I am trapped, confined, and bound by nagging doubts and fears. But is Banquo dead?]]

FIRST MURDERER: Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature. [[Yes, my good lord: he's lying safely in a ditch with twenty deep wounds in his head, any one of which would have killed him.]]

MACBETH: Thanks for that: There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow We'll hear, ourselves, again. [[Thanks for that. The grown serpent is dead; the little worm that has escaped will eventually become poisonous, but for now, it's harmless. Get out of here. We'll speak again tomorrow.]]

LADY MACBETH: My royal lord, You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making, 'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it. [[My royal lord, you are not being a good host; a party is a failure if the host doesn't tell everyone how welcome they are. Otherwise, we might as well eat at home, and the greetings are just empty gestures.]]

MACBETH: Sweet remembrancer! Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both! [[Sweet reminder! May we digest our food well and stay healthy.]]

LENNOX: May't please your highness sit. [[May Your Highness please sit down.]]

MACBETH: Here had we now our country's honour roof'd, Were the graced person of our Banquo present; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance! [[We would have all of Scotland's finest people gathered here, if only Banquo were here with us; I can only assume he is being rude rather than that something bad has happened to him.]]

ROSS: His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness To grace us with your royal company. [[His absence, sir, is a broken promise. Please honor us with your presence.]]

MACBETH: The table's full. [[The table is full.]]

LENNOX: Here is a place reserved, sir. [[Here is a place saved for you, sir.]]

MACBETH: Where? [[Where?]]

LENNOX: Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness? [[Here, my good lord. What is wrong, Your Highness?]]

MACBETH: Which of you have done this? [[Which of you has done this?]]

LORDS: What, my good lord? [[What, my good lord?]]

MACBETH: Thou canst not say I did it: never shake Thy gory locks at me. [[You can't say that I did it; don't shake your bloody hair at me.]]

ROSS: Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well. [[Gentlemen, stand up: his highness is not well.]]

LADY MACBETH: Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well: if much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion: Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man? [[Sit down, worthy friends; my husband is often like this and has been since he was young. Please, stay seated; the spell is only temporary. If you stare, you will upset him and make the fit last longer. Eat and don't pay attention to him. Are you a man?]]

MACBETH: Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil. [[Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at things that would terrify the devil himself.]]

LADY MACBETH: O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear: This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman's story at a winter's fire, Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all's done, You look but on a stool. [[Oh, nonsense! This is just a picture of what you are afraid of. This is like the dagger you said was leading you to Duncan. These fits and starts, not real fear, would only be believed in a woman's story by a fire in winter, told by her grandmother. Shame on you! Why are you making such faces? In the end, you are just staring at a stool.]]

MACBETH: Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too. If charnel-houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites. [[Please, look there! See! Look! What do you think? Why should I care? If you can nod, then speak too. If graveyards must send the people we bury back to us, our tombs will be the stomachs of scavenging birds.]]

LADY MACBETH: What, quite unmann'd in folly? [[What, are you completely out of control?]]

MACBETH: If I stand here, I saw him. [[If I am standing here, then I saw him.]]

LADY MACBETH: Fie, for shame! [[Shame on you!]]

MACBETH: Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, Ere human statute purged the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd Too terrible for the ear: the times have been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools: this is more strange Than such a murder is. [[There has always been bloodshed, before laws were created to stop murder; and even since then, murders have been too terrible to hear about. There was a time when, if someone's brains were bashed out, he would die, and that was the end of it; but now they are rising again, with all the wounds from their murders on their heads, and pushing us off our seats. This is stranger than murder itself.]]

LADY MACBETH: My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. [[My worthy lord, your noble friends miss you.]]

MACBETH: I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends, I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full. I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst, And all to all. [[I forget myself. Don't stare at me, my most worthy friends; I have a strange problem, which is nothing to those who know me. Come, love and health to all of you; then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill it up. I drink to the happiness of everyone at the table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; I wish he were here! To everyone, and to him, we toast, and to everyone!]]

LORDS: Our duties, and the pledge. [[We return our loyalty and raise our glasses.]]

MACBETH: Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with! [[Get out of here! Leave my sight! May the earth swallow you! Your bones are hollow, and your blood is cold; there is no thought in those eyes that you are staring at me with!]]

LADY MACBETH: Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other; Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. [[Think of this, noble friends, as something that often happens; it's nothing more than that. It's only ruining the party.]]

MACBETH: What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble: or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword; If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence! Why, so: being gone, I am a man again. Pray you, sit still. [[I dare to do anything that any man dares. Come at me like a Russian bear, an armed rhinoceros, or a Hyrcanian tiger; take any shape other than that, and my nerves will never tremble. Or come back to life and challenge me to a duel in the desert; if I am still trembling, call me a little girl. Get out of here, you horrible ghost! Unnatural mockery, get out! Good, you're gone, I am a man again. Please, sit down.]]

LADY MACBETH: You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder. [[You have ruined the party and destroyed the good mood with your amazing outburst.]]

MACBETH: Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine is blanched with fear. [[Can such things be real and pass over us like a summer cloud without us being amazed? You make me a stranger to myself, because I can't believe that you can see such things and still have color in your cheeks, when mine are white with fear.]]

ROSS: What sights, my lord? [[What sights, my lord?]]

LADY MACBETH: I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night: Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. [[Please, don't speak; he's getting worse and worse; questions anger him. Good night, everyone. Don't bother to leave in order, just go immediately.]]

LENNOX: Good night; and better health Attend his majesty! [[Good night; and may His Majesty have better health!]]

LADY MACBETH: A kind good night to all! [[A kind good night to all.]]

MACBETH: It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood: Stones have been known to move and trees to speak; Augurs and understood relations have By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood. What is the night? [[There will be more violence; they say, blood demands blood. Stones have been known to move and trees to talk; fortune tellers have used magpies, crows, and rooks to reveal murderers. What time is it?]]

LADY MACBETH: Almost at odds with morning, which is which. [[Almost time for morning, but it's hard to tell.]]

MACBETH: How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding? [[What did you say? That Macduff refused to come when I summoned him?]]

LADY MACBETH: Did you send to him, sir? [[Did you send someone to summon him, sir?]]

MACBETH: I hear it by the way; but I will send: There's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow, And betimes I will, to the weird sisters: More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er: Strange things I have in head, that will to hand; Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd. [[I heard it indirectly, but I will send someone. There is someone in his house whom I am paying. Tomorrow, very early, I will go to the witches; I am determined to know more from them, by any means necessary. For my own sake, everything else is less important: I have gone so far into this bloody river that it is just as hard to go back as it is to keep going. I have strange things in my head that I need to do; I need to act before I think.]]

LADY MACBETH: You lack the season of all natures, sleep. [[You need what everyone needs: sleep.]]

MACBETH: Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use: We are yet but young in deed. [[Come, we'll go to sleep. My strange behavior is just the fear of a beginner who needs to get used to it: we are still new to crime.]]

FIRST WITCH: Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly. [[Why, what's wrong, Hecate! You look angry.]]

HECATE: Have I not reason, beldams as you are, Saucy and overbold? How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never call'd to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now: get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i' the morning: thither he Will come to know his destiny: Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and every thing beside. I am for the air; this night I'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end: Great business must be wrought ere noon: Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vaporous drop profound; I'll catch it ere it come to ground: And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion: He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear: And you all know, security Is mortals' chiefest enemy. Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me. [[Don't I have reason to be angry with you, you rude and overconfident hags? How dare you bargain with Macbeth, speaking in riddles and meddling with death, without me? I am the mistress of your magic and the planner of all your evil deeds, but you never called me to take part or show the glory of our art. And, what's worse, everything you've done has been for a spoiled and angry man who, like others, only cares about himself and not about you. But make up for it now; get out of here, and meet me in the morning at the pit of Acheron, where he will come to learn his destiny. Bring all your equipment and spells. I'm going to the air; I'll spend tonight working for a terrible and fatal end. Great things need to be done before noon. There is a drop of mist hanging on the edge of the moon; I will catch it before it falls to the ground. And then, with magic, I will make it into spirits whose illusions will trick Macbeth into ruining himself. He will defy fate, scorn death, and be overly confident, and as you all know, overconfidence is the worst thing that can happen to mortals. Listen! I am being called; my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud, waiting for me.]]

FIRST WITCH: Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again. [[Come on, let's hurry; she'll be back soon.]]

LENNOX: My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret further: only, I say, Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead: And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late; Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd, For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear, That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive To hear the men deny't. So that, I say, He has borne all things well: and I do think That had he Duncan's sons under his key— As, an't please heaven, he shall not—they should find What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself? [[My previous words have only hinted at what you are thinking, which is obvious. I only mean to say that things have been handled strangely. Good King Duncan was mourned by Macbeth, but, of course, he was dead. And brave Banquo walked out too late; you could even say that Fleance killed him, because Fleance ran away. People shouldn't walk around at night. And who can avoid thinking how awful it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their good father? A terrible crime! How sad Macbeth was about it! And didn't he righteously kill those two guards who were drunk and asleep? Wasn't that noble of him? And wise, too, because it would have angered anyone to hear them deny it. So, I say, Macbeth has handled everything well. And I think that if he had Duncan's sons in his power—which, thank God, he doesn't—they would realize what it means to kill a father, and so would Fleance. But enough of that. Because he spoke openly and failed to attend the tyrant's feast, I hear that Macduff is out of favor. Sir, can you tell me where Macduff has gone?]]

LORD: The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court, and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward: That, by the help of these—with Him above To ratify the work—we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage and receive free honours: All which we pine for now: and this report Hath so exasperate the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war. [[Duncan's son, from whom this tyrant has taken what is rightfully his, is living at the English court, and is treated so well by the pious King Edward that bad luck can't harm his reputation. Macduff has gone there to ask the holy king to help him awaken Northumberland and the warlike Siward so that with their help—and with God's blessing—we can once again have food on our tables, sleep through the night, be free from murder at our feasts, be able to pay proper respect and receive deserved honors—all things we long for now. This news has made Macbeth so angry that he is planning some act of war.]]

LENNOX: Sent he to Macduff? [[Has Macbeth sent for Macduff?]]

LORD: He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,' The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.' [[He did. And after Macduff said firmly, "Sir, I will not," the angry messenger turned his back and mumbled to himself, as if to say, "You'll regret giving me that answer."]]

LENNOX: And that well might Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed! [[That should warn Macduff to be careful and stay as far away from Macbeth as he can. I hope a holy angel flies to the English court and tells them Macduff's message before he even arrives so that a blessing can quickly return to our suffering country, now under the power of an evil tyrant!]]

LORD: I'll send my prayers with him. [[I'll send my prayers with Macduff.]]

[[Piece of a swamp snake, boil and bake in the cauldron; eye of a newt and toe of a frog, wool of a bat and tongue of a dog, adder's tongue and a blindworm's sting, lizard's leg and an owlet's wing, for a charm to cause powerful trouble, boil and bubble like a hellish soup.]]

ALL: Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble. [[Double, double, work and trouble; fire burn, and cauldron bubble.]]

THIRD WITCH: Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witches' mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat, and slips of yew Silver'd in the moon's eclipse, Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, Finger of birth-strangled babe Ditch-deliver'd by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab: Add thereto a tiger's chaudron, For the ingredients of our cauldron. [[Dragon scale, wolf's tooth, a witch's mummy, the stomach of a shark that has been eating, root of hemlock dug up in the dark, liver of a Jew who blasphemed, goat bile, twigs of yew silvered by the light of a lunar eclipse, nose of a Turk and Tartar's lips, finger of a baby strangled at birth and born in a ditch, make the soup thick and sticky. Add a tiger's entrails to the ingredients in our cauldron.]]

ALL: Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble. [[Double, double, work and trouble; fire burn, and cauldron bubble.]]

SECOND WITCH: Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good. [[Cool it with a baboon's blood, then the spell is strong and complete.]]

HECATE: O well done! I commend your pains; And every one shall share i' the gains; And now about the cauldron sing, Live elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in. [[Oh, well done! I commend your hard work; everyone will share in the rewards. Now sing around the cauldron, you elves and fairies, making everything we put in even more magical.]]

SECOND WITCH: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks! [[My thumbs are tingling; something evil is coming this way. Open the doors for whoever knocks!]]

MACBETH: How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is't you do? [[What's going on, you secret, dark witches of midnight! What are you doing?]]

ALL: A deed without a name. [[A deed that cannot be described.]]

MACBETH: I conjure you, by that which you profess, Howe'er you come to know it, answer me: Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up; Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down; Though castles topple on their warders' heads; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure Of nature's germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken; answer me To what I ask you. [[I command you, by your magic, to answer me, however you know what you know: even if you release the winds and let them attack the churches; even if the stormy waves destroy ships; even if the crops are flattened and the trees are blown down; even if castles fall on the heads of their guards; even if palaces and pyramids collapse; even if the seeds of life are all destroyed, tell me what I ask you!]]

FIRST WITCH: Speak. [[Speak.]]

SECOND WITCH: Demand. [[Ask your question.]]

THIRD WITCH: We'll answer. [[We'll answer.]]

FIRST WITCH: Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters? [[Do you want to hear it from us, or from the spirits who command us?]]

MACBETH: Call 'em; let me see 'em. [[Call the spirits; let me see them.]]

FIRST WITCH: Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten From the murderer's gibbet throw Into the flame. Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show! [[Pour in the blood of a pig that ate her nine piglets. Throw into the flames the grease that dripped from a murderer's gallows. Come, whatever spirit you are, show yourself!]]

FIRST APPARITION: Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough. [[Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Be careful of Macduff; be careful of the Thane of Fife. Let me go. That's enough.]]

MACBETH: Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one word more,— [[Whatever you are, thank you for the warning; you have said what I was already afraid of. But one more question.]]

FIRST WITCH: He will not be commanded: here's another, More potent than the first. [[He can't be commanded to stay; here is another spirit, even stronger than the first.]]

SECOND APPARITION: Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! [[Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!]]

MACBETH: Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee. [[If I had three ears, I would listen to you.]]

SECOND APPARITION: Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth. [[Be bloody, bold, and determined; laugh at the power of other men, because no one born of a woman can hurt Macbeth.]]

MACBETH: Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee? But yet I'll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live; That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, And sleep in spite of thunder. What is this That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty? [[Then Macduff, live; why should I be afraid of you? But I will make doubly sure and take fate into my own hands: you will not live, so that I can tell fear that it's lying, and sleep even through thunder. What is this apparition that rises like the child of a king and wears a crown on his forehead, showing that he is a king?]]

ALL: Listen, but speak not to't. [[Listen, but don't speak to it.]]

THIRD APPARITION: Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are: Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him. [[Be brave as a lion, proud, and don't worry about who gets angry, who worries, or who the conspirators are: Macbeth will never be defeated until the Great Birnam Wood marches to Dunsinane Hill to fight against him.]]

MACBETH: That will never be Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good! Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever Reign in this kingdom? [[That will never happen! Who can force a forest to move, tell a tree to uproot itself? Sweet prophecies! Wonderful! Rebellion will never rise until Birnam Wood rises, and Macbeth will live out his natural life and die a normal death. Still, my heart is beating fast because I want to know one more thing: can you tell me if Banquo's descendants will ever be kings in this country?]]

ALL: Seek to know no more. [[Don't ask anything else.]]

MACBETH: I will be satisfied: deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know. Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this? [[I must know! If you deny me this, may an eternal curse fall on you! Tell me! Why is the cauldron sinking, and what is that music?]]

FIRST WITCH: Show! [[Show!]]

SECOND WITCH: Show! [[Show!]]

THIRD WITCH: Show! [[Show!]]

ALL: Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; Come like shadows, so depart! [[Show him what he wants to see, but make his heart heavy; appear like ghosts, and then disappear!]]

MACBETH: Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down! Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair, Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. A third is like the former. Filthy hags! Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes! What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more: And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass Which shows me many more; and some I see That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry: Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true; For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, And points at them for his. What, is this so? [[You look too much like Banquo's ghost; get out of here! Your crown burns my eyes! And your hair, your golden brow, is like the first one. A third is like the others. Disgusting hags! Why are you showing me this? A fourth one! My eyes are popping out! Will this line of kings stretch out until the end of time? Another one! A seventh! I can't watch anymore. And yet the eighth appears, holding a mirror that shows me even more kings; and some of them hold two globes and three scepters! A horrible sight! Now I see it's true; because bloody-haired Banquo is smiling at me and pointing at them as his descendants. What, is this really true?]]

FIRST WITCH: Ay, sir, all this is so: but why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly? Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, And show the best of our delights: I'll charm the air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round: That this great king may kindly say, Our duties did his welcome pay. [[Yes, sir, all of this is true, but why is Macbeth standing there so amazed? Come, sisters, let's cheer him up and show him our best delights: I'll charm the air with music while you dance a strange dance, so that this great king can say that we gave him a good welcome.]]

MACBETH: Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar! Come in, without there! [[Where are they? Gone? May this evil hour be marked as cursed forever! Come in, someone!]]

LENNOX: What's your grace's will? [[What does Your Highness want?]]

MACBETH: Saw you the weird sisters? [[Did you see the witches?]]

LENNOX: No, my lord. [[No, my lord.]]

MACBETH: Came they not by you? [[Didn't they pass by you?]]

LENNOX: No, indeed, my lord. [[No, indeed, my lord.]]

MACBETH: Infected be the air whereon they ride; And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear The galloping of horse: who was't came by? [[May the air they ride on be infected, and may everyone who trusts them be damned! I did hear horses galloping; who was it that came by?]]

LENNOX: 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England. [[It's two or three messengers, my lord, who bring word that Macduff has fled to England.]]

MACBETH: Fled to England! [[Fled to England!]]

LENNOX: Ay, my good lord. [[Yes, my good lord.]]

MACBETH: Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits: The flighty purpose never is o'ertook Unless the deed go with it; from this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand. And even now, To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: The castle of Macduff I will surprise; Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool; This deed I'll do before this purpose cool. But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen? Come, bring me where they are. [[Time, you make my terrible actions happen faster than I can think. An idea will never get done unless it's followed by an action. From now on, whatever comes into my mind first, I will do first. And right now, to follow my thoughts with action, as soon as I think it, I'll do it. I will attack Macduff's castle, seize Fife, and kill with the sword his wife, his children, and all the unlucky people related to him. I won't boast like a fool; I will do this deed before I change my mind. But no more visions! Where are those gentlemen? Come, take me to them.]]

LADY MACDUFF: What had he done, to make him fly the land? [[What has he done to make him run away from Scotland?]]

ROSS: You must have patience, madam. [[You must be patient, madam.]]

LADY MACDUFF: He had none: His flight was madness: when our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors. [[He was not patient. His flight was crazy. When we don't commit treason, our fear makes us look like traitors.]]

ROSS: You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. [[You don't know if it was his wisdom or his fear that made him flee.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not; He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear and nothing is the love; As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason. [[Wisdom! To leave his wife, his children, his home, and his titles in a place that he's running away from himself? He doesn't love us. He has no natural affection, because even the smallest bird will fight to protect her young against an owl. It's all fear and no love; there is no wisdom in fleeing against all reason.]]

ROSS: My dearest coz, I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further; But cruel are the times, when we are traitors And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move. I take my leave of you: Shall not be long but I'll be here again: Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward To what they were before. My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you! [[My dearest cousin, please control yourself. As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he knows what is best in these times. I can't say more, but these are cruel times, when we are called traitors without knowing it, when we believe rumors because of what we fear, even though we don't know what we fear; but we float on a wild and violent sea, tossed about in every direction. I'll take my leave now. I'll be back soon; things will either get better, or they will go back to the way they were before. My pretty cousin, may God bless you!]]

LADY MACDUFF: Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless. [[He has a father, but he's like he doesn't have one.]]

ROSS: I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, It would be my disgrace and your discomfort: I take my leave at once. [[If I stay any longer, I will only make things worse for you and me. I'll leave now.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Sirrah, your father's dead; And what will you do now? How will you live? [[Boy, your father's dead; what will you do now? How will you live?]]

SON: As birds do, mother. [[Like birds, Mother.]]

LADY MACDUFF: What, with worms and flies? [[What, eating worms and flies?]]

SON: With what I get, I mean; and so do they. [[I mean with whatever I can find, and that's what they do.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, The pitfall nor the gin. [[Poor bird! You would never fear a net, birdlime, a pit, or a trap.]]

SON: Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. My father is not dead, for all your saying. [[Why should I, Mother? Poor birds aren't worth catching. My father is not dead, no matter what you say.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father? [[Yes, he is dead; what will you do without a father?]]

SON: Nay, how will you do for a husband? [[Well, what will you do without a husband?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. [[Why, I can buy twenty of them at any market.]]

SON: Then you'll buy 'em to sell again. [[Then you'll buy them to sell them again.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith, With wit enough for thee. [[You're speaking with all the intelligence you have, and, in truth, that's intelligent enough for you.]]

SON: Was my father a traitor, mother? [[Was my father a traitor, Mother?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Ay, that he was. [[Yes, he was.]]

SON: What is a traitor? [[What's a traitor?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Why, one that swears and lies. [[Why, someone who swears and lies.]]

SON: And be all traitors that do so? [[Are all people who do that traitors?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged. [[Everyone who does that is a traitor and must be hanged.]]

SON: And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? [[And must everyone who swears and lies be hanged?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Every one. [[Every one.]]

SON: Who must hang them? [[Who must hang them?]]

LADY MACDUFF: Why, the honest men. [[Why, the honest men.]]

SON: Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. [[Then the liars and swearers are fools, because there are enough liars and swearers to beat the honest men and hang them up.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father? [[Now, God help you, you little monkey! But what will you do without a father?]]

SON: If he were dead, you'ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father. [[If he were dead, you would cry for him; and if you didn't cry, that would be a good sign that I would have a new father quickly.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Poor prattler, how thou talk'st! [[Poor little talker, look at how you prattle!]]

MESSENGER: Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, Though in your state of honour I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly: If you will take a homely man's advice, Be not found here; hence, with your little ones. To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer. [[God bless you, fair lady! I don't think you know me, but I am familiar with your noble status. I am afraid some danger is coming near you; if you will take a common man's advice, don't stay here; leave with your children. I think I am being too harsh by frightening you like this; to do anything worse to you would be terrible cruelty, which is getting very close to you. May Heaven protect you! I can't stay here any longer.]]

LADY MACDUFF: Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world; where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defence, To say I have done no harm? What are these faces? [[Where should I run? I haven't done anything wrong. But now I remember that I am in this world, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is considered foolish and dangerous. Why, then, should I say I haven't done anything wrong? What are these people?]]

FIRST MURDERER: Where is your husband? [[Where is your husband?]]

LADY MACDUFF: I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him. [[I hope he's in no place so unholy that people like you can find him.]]

FIRST MURDERER: He's a traitor. [[He's a traitor.]]

SON: Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain! [[You're lying, you villain with the shaggy hair!]]

FIRST MURDERER: What, you egg! Young fry of treachery! [[What, you little egg! Young child of treachery!]]

SON: He has kill'd me, mother: Run away, I pray you! [[He has killed me, Mother: run away, please!]]

MALCOLM: Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there Weep our sad bosoms empty. [[Let's find some isolated, shady place where we can cry our hearts out.]]

MACDUFF: Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolour. [[Let's rather hold on to our swords and, like good men, stand over our fallen country. Every morning, new widows wail, new orphans cry, new sorrows strike the heavens so hard that it echoes as if it feels Scotland's pain and yells with grief.]]

MALCOLM: What I believe I'll wail, What know believe, and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest: you have loved him well. He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young; but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry god. [[I will cry for what I believe, believe what I know, and fix whatever I can, when the time is right. What you have said may be true. This tyrant, whose name alone hurts to say, was once thought to be good. You have loved him well. He hasn't hurt you yet. I am young, and you may have to betray me to him, and it would be wise to offer a weak, poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god.]]

MACDUFF: I am not treacherous. [[I am not treacherous.]]

MALCOLM: But Macbeth is. A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon; That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose: Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell; Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so. [[But Macbeth is. A good and honest person may turn bad when ordered to by the king. I ask your pardon; I can't change what I think you are: angels are still bright even though the brightest one fell, and even if evil tries to look like goodness, goodness still looks like goodness.]]

MACDUFF: I have lost my hopes. [[I have lost all hope.]]

MALCOLM: Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking? I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonours, But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think. [[Maybe those doubts are where you lost your hopes. Why did you leave your wife and child in such danger, those precious people you love so much, without saying goodbye? Please, don't let my suspicions shame you, but I am only trying to protect myself. You may be completely honest, whatever I may think.]]

MACDUFF: Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord: I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp, And the rich East to boot. [[Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny! Make your foundation strong, because goodness can't stop you: wear your wrongs; you have earned your title! Farewell, lord: I would not be the villain you think I am, even if I could have all the lands Macbeth controls and the treasures of the East as well.]]

MALCOLM: Be not offended: I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds: I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands: but, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed. [[Don't be offended; I am not speaking because I am completely afraid of you. I think our country is collapsing under Macbeth's tyranny; it weeps, it bleeds, and each new day makes her wounds worse. I think that there would be people who would support my claim to the throne, and I have the offer of thousands of good soldiers from England; but even with all that, when I defeat Macbeth, my poor country will be worse than it was before, suffering in more ways than it ever has, under the king that will come after him.]]

MACDUFF: What should he be? [[Who could that be?]]

MALCOLM: It is myself I mean: in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compared With my confineless harms. [[I mean myself; I know that I have so many vices that when they are revealed, the evil Macbeth will seem as pure as snow, and the people will think he's as gentle as a lamb compared to the endless harm I will cause.]]

MACDUFF: Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd In evils to top Macbeth. [[Even hell can't produce a devil more evil than Macbeth.]]

MALCOLM: I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name: but there's no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters, Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will: better Macbeth Than such an one to reign. [[I agree that he is bloody, lustful, greedy, false, deceitful, quick-tempered, malicious, full of every sin there is; but I have no limit to my lust; all the wives, daughters, matrons, and maids in Scotland couldn't satisfy my desire, and I would break through any moral barrier that stood in the way of my will. It would be better for Macbeth to reign than for someone like that.]]

MACDUFF: Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny; it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings. But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours: you may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink. We have willing dames enough: there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclined. [[Endless lust is a tyranny in itself; it has caused the downfall of many kings. But don't be afraid to take what is yours; you can have as many pleasures as you want, and still hide it from everyone. We have plenty of willing women; you couldn't be such a monster that you could use up all the women who would offer themselves to a king who wanted them.]]

MALCOLM: With this there grows In my most ill-composed affection such A stanchless avarice that, were I king, I should cut off the nobles for their lands, Desire his jewels and this other's house: And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more; that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth. [[With that, there grows in my corrupted heart a boundless greed that if I were king, I would kill the nobles for their land, want one person's jewels and another person's house; and the more I had, the more I would want, to the point that I would start unjust wars against the good and loyal just to take their wealth.]]

MACDUFF: This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will. Of your mere own: all these are portable, With other graces weigh'd. [[Greed is a more deeply rooted and harmful vice than lust that only seems bad, and it has caused the death of many kings. But don't be afraid; Scotland has enough wealth to satisfy you, completely your own; these desires can be controlled if you also have good qualities.]]

MALCOLM: But I have none: the king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them, but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth. [[But I have none of the qualities a king should have, like justice, truthfulness, self-control, stability, generosity, perseverance, mercy, humility, devotion, patience, courage, and strength. I hate them all; but I am good at every kind of crime, committing them in many ways. If I had the power, I would pour the sweet milk of peace into hell, destroy world peace, and ruin everything good on earth.]]

MACDUFF: O Scotland, Scotland! [[Oh, Scotland, Scotland!]]

MALCOLM: If such a one be fit to govern, speak: I am as I have spoken. [[If someone like that is fit to rule, tell me now; I am what I have described.]]

MACDUFF: Fit to govern! No, not to live. O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed, And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast, Thy hope ends here! [[Fit to rule? No, not even fit to live! Oh, miserable nation, ruled by a bloody tyrant, when will you see better days again, since the true heir to the throne has damned himself and cursed his own family? Your royal father was a saintly king; the queen who bore you spent more time on her knees praying than on her feet, and suffered every day of her life. Goodbye! These terrible things you say about yourself have forced me to leave Scotland. Oh, my heart, there is no more hope for Scotland.]]

MALCOLM: Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From over-credulous haste: but God above Deal between thee and me! for even now I put myself to thy direction, and Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, At no time broke my faith, would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life: my first false speaking Was this upon myself: what I am truly, Is thine and my poor country's to command: Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth. Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent? [[Macduff, this noble outburst, born of honesty, has cleared away all my doubts and convinced me of your truth and honor. The devilish Macbeth has used many of these tricks to try to get me under his power, and I have been too careful and cautious to be tricked. But may God be the judge between you and me, because right now I am putting myself in your hands and taking back everything bad I said about myself, because they are all lies. I am still a virgin, I have never broken an oath, I have hardly wanted what was mine, I have never broken my word, I wouldn't even betray the devil to one of his demons, and I love truth as much as life. The things I said about myself were the first lies I have ever told. What I really am is yours and my country's to command. In fact, before you came here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers, was already preparing to set out. Now we will go together, and may good luck favor our just cause! Why are you silent?]]

MACDUFF: Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile. [[So many good and bad things at once makes it hard to know how to feel.]]

MALCOLM: Well; more anon.—Comes the king forth, I pray you? [[Well, we'll talk about it later. Is the king coming out, please?]]

DOCTOR: Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure: their malady convinces The great assay of art; but at his touch— Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand— They presently amend. [[Yes, sir; there are many miserable people waiting for him to heal them; their disease is too strong for the power of medicine, but when he touches them—because God has made his hands so holy—they are healed immediately.]]

MALCOLM: I thank you, doctor. [[I thank you, doctor.]]

MACDUFF: What's the disease he means? [[What disease is he talking about?]]

MALCOLM: 'Tis call'd the evil: A most miraculous work in this good king; Which often, since my here-remain in England, I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people, All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures, Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken, To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace. [[It's called scrofula, a disease that this good king miraculously cures, which I have seen him do often since I have been in England. How he prays to God, only he knows, but he cures people who have strangely been afflicted, people with swollen sores who are horrible to look at and beyond any help from surgery, by hanging a gold coin around their necks and saying holy prayers; and it is said that he leaves the power of healing to his successors. With this power, he has the gift of prophecy, and other blessings surround his throne, showing that he is full of God's grace.]]

MACDUFF: See, who comes here? [[Look, who's coming here?]]

MALCOLM: My countryman; but yet I know him not. [[Someone from Scotland, but I don't recognize him.]]

MACDUFF: My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. [[My gentle cousin, welcome here.]]

MALCOLM: I know him now. Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers! [[I know him now. Good God, quickly remove the things that have made us strangers!]]

ROSS: Sir, amen. [[Sir, amen.]]

MACDUFF: Stands Scotland where it did? [[Is Scotland the same as it was?]]

ROSS: Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken. [[Alas, poor country! It's almost afraid to know itself. It can't be called our mother anymore, but our grave, where only those who know nothing can smile; where sighs, groans, and screams fill the air but are ignored; where violent sorrow seems normal, and no one asks who has died; and good people die before the flowers in their hair have withered, dying before they have time to be sick.]]

MACDUFF: O, relation Too nice, and yet too true! [[Oh, a description that is too accurate, and yet true!]]

MALCOLM: What's the newest grief? [[What's the latest sorrow?]]

ROSS: That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker: Each minute teems a new one. [[The sorrow from an hour ago seems old, because every minute there is a new one.]]

MACDUFF: How does my wife? [[How is my wife?]]

ROSS: Why, well. [[Why, she's fine.]]

MACDUFF: And all my children? [[And all my children?]]

ROSS: Well too. [[They're fine too.]]

MACDUFF: The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? [[The tyrant hasn't attacked their peace?]]

ROSS: No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em. [[No, they were at peace when I left them.]]

MACDUFF: But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't? [[But don't be stingy with your words; what's happening?]]

ROSS: When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out; Which was to my belief witness'd the rather, For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot: Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses. [[When I came here to tell you the news, which has been a heavy burden for me, there was a rumor that many worthy men were in revolt; and I believed this because I saw Macbeth's army preparing for war. Now is the time for help; your presence in Scotland would inspire soldiers and make our women fight to escape our terrible suffering.]]

MALCOLM: Be't their comfort We are coming thither: gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out. [[Let that be their comfort; we are coming there. Good England has lent us the excellent Siward and ten thousand men; there is no better soldier in the Christian world.]]

ROSS: Would I could answer This comfort with the like! But I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them. [[I wish I could answer that comfort with the same kind of news! But I have words that should be howled out in the desert, where no one could hear them.]]

MACDUFF: What concern they? The general cause? or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast? [[What are they about? The fate of Scotland, or is it a personal sorrow that I alone must bear?]]

ROSS: No mind that's honest But in it shares some woe; though the main part Pertains to you alone. [[Everyone who is honest will share some of the pain, though you alone will bear the worst of it.]]

MACDUFF: If it be mine, Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it. [[If it concerns me, don't keep it from me, tell me quickly.]]

ROSS: Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard. [[Don't hate me forever because of what I am about to tell you, the worst news you have ever heard.]]

MACDUFF: Hum! I guess at it. [[Hmm! I think I know what you are going to say.]]

ROSS: Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner, Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer, To add the death of you. [[Your castle has been attacked; your wife and children brutally murdered; to describe how it happened would be like killing you all over again.]]

MALCOLM: Merciful heaven! What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break. [[Merciful heavens! What, man! Don't pull your hat over your eyes; give words to your sorrow: grief that is unspoken whispers to the overwhelmed heart and tells it to break.]]

MACDUFF: My children too? [[My children too?]]

ROSS: Wife, children, servants, all That could be found. [[Wife, children, servants, everyone who could be found.]]

MACDUFF: And I must be from thence! My wife kill'd too? [[And I had to be away from there! My wife killed too?]]

ROSS: I have said. [[I have said it all.]]

MALCOLM: Be comforted: Let's make us medicines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief. [[Be comforted; let's use our great revenge as medicine to cure this deadly grief.]]

MACDUFF: He has no children. All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All? What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop? [[He has no children, so he wouldn't understand. All my pretty children? Did you say all? Oh, that devilish kite! All? What, all my pretty chicks and their mother killed at once?]]

MALCOLM: Dispute it like a man. [[Fight back like a man.]]

MACDUFF: I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee! naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now! [[I will fight back, but I also have to feel it as a man; I can't help remembering that those were the people I loved most. Did heaven watch it happen and not try to help? It was all because of my sins, not theirs, that they were killed. May they rest in peace.]]

MALCOLM: Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. [[Let this be the thing that sharpens your sword: let your grief turn into anger; don't dull your heart, enrage it.]]

MACDUFF: O, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission; front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, Heaven forgive him too! [[Oh, I could cry like a woman and brag with my tongue like a coward! But, kind heavens, let there be no delay; bring me face to face with this fiend of Scotland; let me get close enough to him to kill him with my sword; if he escapes, may heaven forgive him too!]]

MALCOLM: This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the king; our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may: The night is long that never finds the day. [[That sounds like a man. Come, let's go to the king; our army is ready; all we need is his permission to leave. Macbeth is ready to be overthrown, and the heavens are preparing to strike him down. Take what comfort you can find: even the longest night must end in daylight.]]

DOCTOR: I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? [[I have stayed up two nights with you, but I haven't seen anything that supports your story. When did she last walk in her sleep?]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. [[Since the king left for the battlefield, I have seen her get out of bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out paper, fold it, write on it, read it, then seal it, and go back to bed, all while she is fast asleep.]]

DOCTOR: A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say? [[It is very strange to be asleep and awake at the same time! Besides her walking and other actions in this sleepwalking state, what have you ever heard her say?]]

GENTLEWOMAN: That, sir, which I will not report after her. [[I can't tell you what she says.]]

DOCTOR: You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should. [[You can tell me, and it's important that you do.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to confirm my speech. Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close. [[I won't tell you or anyone else, because there is no one to back up my story. Look, here she comes! This is what she always does; and, I swear, she's fast asleep. Watch her, and stay hidden.]]

DOCTOR: How came she by that light? [[Where did she get that candle?]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her command. [[Why, it was next to her. She has a candle by her constantly; she ordered it.]]

DOCTOR: You see, her eyes are open. [[You see, her eyes are open.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Ay, but their sense is shut. [[Yes, but she doesn't see anything.]]

DOCTOR: What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands. [[What is she doing now? Look how she rubs her hands.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands: I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. [[She always does that, like she's washing her hands: I have seen her do this for fifteen minutes at a time.]]

LADY MACBETH: Yet here's a spot. [[But here's still a spot.]]

DOCTOR: Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. [[Listen! She's talking: I will write down what she says so I can remember it better.]]

LADY MACBETH: Out, damned spot! out, I say!—One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't.—Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?—Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him. [[Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One, two: well, then, it's time to do it. Hell is dark! Shame on you, my lord, shame! A soldier, and afraid? Why should we care who knows, when no one can question our power? And who would have thought the old man would have had so much blood in him?]]

DOCTOR: Do you mark that? [[Do you notice that?]]

LADY MACBETH: The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?— What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with this starting. [[The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What, will these hands never be clean? Stop, my lord, stop; you're ruining everything by reacting that way.]]

DOCTOR: Go to, go to; you have known what you should not. [[You shouldn't be saying these things; you know things you shouldn't know.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known. [[She has said things she shouldn't, I'm sure of that: only God knows what she knows.]]

LADY MACBETH: Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh! [[I can still smell the blood here; all the perfumes in Arabia couldn't make my hand smell better. Oh, oh, oh!]]

DOCTOR: What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. [[What a sigh! Her heart is full of guilt.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. [[I wouldn't want such a guilty heart, even if it meant being queen of the world.]]

DOCTOR: Well, well, well,— [[Well, well, well—]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Pray God it be, sir. [[I hope so, sir.]]

DOCTOR: This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds. [[This disease is beyond my medical skills, but I have known people who walked in their sleep and still died peacefully in their beds.]]

LADY MACBETH: Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out on's grave. [[Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; don't look so pale. I'm telling you again, Banquo is buried; he can't come out of his grave.]]

DOCTOR: Even so? [[Really?]]

LADY MACBETH: To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate: come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed! [[To bed, to bed! There's knocking at the gate: come on, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed!]]

DOCTOR: Will she go now to bed? [[Will she go to bed now?]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Directly. [[Immediately.]]

DOCTOR: Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets: More needs she the divine than the physician. God, God forgive us all! Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. I think, but dare not speak. [[There are bad rumors going around; unnatural acts cause unnatural problems. Guilty minds will confess their secrets to their pillows. She needs a priest more than a doctor. God, God forgive us all! Take care of her; remove anything that can harm her, and watch her constantly. So, good night; she has overwhelmed my mind and amazed my senses. I have my suspicions, but I dare not say them out loud.]]

GENTLEWOMAN: Good night, good doctor. [[Good night, good doctor.]]

MENTEITH: The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff: Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man. [[The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. Revenge is burning in them; for their dear ones they would awaken a dead man to fight in this grim battle.]]

ANGUS: Near Birnam wood Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming. [[We will meet them near Birnam Wood; that is the way they are coming.]]

CAITHNESS: Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? [[Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother?]]

LENNOX: For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son, And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood. [[I am sure he is not; I have a list of all the noblemen who are fighting: Siward's son is there, and many young men who are fighting for the first time.]]

MENTEITH: What does the tyrant? [[What is the tyrant doing?]]

CAITHNESS: Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies: Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause Within the belt of rule. [[He is heavily fortifying Dunsinane; some say he is mad; others, who hate him less, call it brave rage, but he certainly can't control his wild actions.]]

ANGUS: Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands; Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love: now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe Upon a dwarfish thief. [[Now he feels his secret murders weighing him down; every minute there are rebellions against him; those he commands only obey orders, not out of loyalty. Now he feels his title hanging loosely on him, like a giant's robe on a small thief.]]

MENTEITH: Who then shall blame His pester'd senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there? [[Who can blame his troubled mind for panicking when everything inside him hates him for being there?]]

CAITHNESS: Well, march we on, To give obedience where 'tis truly owed: Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, And with him pour we in our country's purge Each drop of us. [[Well, let's march on to give our loyalty to where it belongs: let's meet the cure for our sick country, and with him, let's pour out our all to cleanse Scotland.]]

LENNOX: Or so much as it needs, To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam. [[Or as much as it takes to help the rightful king and kill the bad. Let's march to Birnam.]]

MACBETH: Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: 'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures: The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. [[Don't bring me any more reports; let them all run away: I can't be touched by fear until Birnam Wood moves to Dunsinane. What is that boy Malcolm? Wasn't he born of a woman? The spirits who know all the future have told me, "Don't be afraid, Macbeth; no man born of a woman will ever defeat you." So run away, you false thanes, and join the English pleasure-seekers! I will never be touched by doubt or fear.]]

MACBETH: The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! Where got'st thou that goose look? [[May the devil curse you black, you pale-faced idiot! Where did you get that stupid look?]]

SERVANT: There is ten thousand— [[There are ten thousand—]]

MACBETH: Geese, villain! [[Geese, you villain!]]

SERVANT: Soldiers, sir. [[Soldiers, sir.]]

MACBETH: Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face? [[Go prick your face to bring some color to it because you are scared, you cowardly boy. What soldiers, idiot? Damn your soul! Your pale cheeks are making everyone afraid. What soldiers, you whey-faced coward?]]

SERVANT: The English force, so please you. [[The English army, if you please.]]

MACBETH: Take thy face hence. Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now. I have lived long enough: my way of life Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf; And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton! [[Get out of my sight. Seyton!—I am sick at heart when I see such things. Seyton, I say! This battle will make me happy forever, or it will destroy me now. I have lived long enough. My life is fading away, like a yellowing leaf; and I can't hope for the things that should come with old age, like honor, love, loyalty, and friends. Instead, I have curses, not loud but deep, and false shows of respect that people's hearts don't mean to give me. Seyton!]]

SEYTON: What is your gracious pleasure? [[What do you want, Your Majesty?]]

MACBETH: What news more? [[What other news do you have?]]

SEYTON: All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported. [[Everything that was reported is true, my lord.]]

MACBETH: I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd. Give me my armour. [[I'll fight until my body is chopped off my bones. Give me my armor.]]

SEYTON: 'Tis not needed yet. [[It's not needed yet.]]

MACBETH: I'll put it on. Send out more horses; skirr the country round; Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour. How does your patient, doctor? [[I'll put it on. Send out more horses; scout the countryside; hang anyone who speaks of fear. Give me my armor. How is your patient, doctor?]]

DOCTOR: Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick coming fancies, That keep her from her rest. [[Not as sick, my lord, but she is troubled by hallucinations that keep her from sleeping.]]

MACBETH: Cure her of that. Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart? [[Cure her of that. Can't you cure a diseased mind, erase painful memories, clear away the troubles in the brain, and use some drug to cleanse the heart of its guilt?]]

DOCTOR: Therein the patient Must minister to himself. [[In that case, the patient must heal herself.]]

MACBETH: Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it. Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff. Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me. Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.—Pull't off, I say.— What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug, Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them? [[Throw medicine to the dogs; I want nothing to do with it. Come on, put my armor on; give me my spear. Seyton, send out the scouts. Doctor, the thanes are running away from me. Come on, hurry up. If you could diagnose my country and cure it, I would praise you so loudly that the echo would praise you too. Take it off, I say. What drug would get rid of these English? Do you hear anything from them?]]

DOCTOR: Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation Makes us hear something. [[Yes, my good lord; your royal army is getting ready, and that's all we hear.]]

MACBETH: Bring it after me. I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane. [[Bring my armor after me. I will not be afraid of death and destruction until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.]]

DOCTOR: Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here. [[If I could just get away from Dunsinane, no amount of money would get me to come back here again.]]

MALCOLM: Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe. [[Cousins, I hope the time is coming soon when we will be safe in our bedrooms.]]

MENTEITH: We doubt it nothing. [[We have no doubt about it.]]

SIWARD: What wood is this before us? [[What is this forest before us?]]

MENTEITH: The wood of Birnam. [[The wood of Birnam.]]

MALCOLM: Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us. [[Let every soldier cut down a branch and carry it in front of him. This will hide the number of our soldiers and confuse their spies.]]

SOLDIERS: It shall be done. [[It will be done.]]

SIWARD: We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before 't. [[We have heard that the confident tyrant is still in Dunsinane and will let us lay siege to the castle.]]

MALCOLM: 'Tis his main hope: For where there is advantage to be given, Both more and less have given him the revolt, And none serve with him but constrained things Whose hearts are absent too. [[That's what he's hoping for, because where there is a chance, many people have deserted him, and those who still serve him are only doing it because they have to, and their hearts aren't in it.]]

MACDUFF: Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership. [[Let us wait and see what happens, and let's be good soldiers.]]

SIWARD: The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe. Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate: Towards which advance the war. [[The time is coming soon when we will know for sure what we have won and what we owe in thanks. What we speculate about now is just uncertain hopes, but the strokes of our swords will decide everything. Let's advance toward the battle.]]

MACBETH: Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up: Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home. [[Hang our flags on the walls. The cry is still, "They're coming!" Our castle is strong enough to laugh at any siege; let them stay there until hunger and disease kill them. If those men weren't forced to fight against us, we could have met them bravely, face to face, and beaten them back to England.]]

MACBETH: What is that noise? [[What is that noise?]]

SEYTON: It is the cry of women, my good lord. [[It is the crying of women, my good lord.]]

MACBETH: I have almost forgot the taste of fears; The time has been, my senses would have cool'd To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors; Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me. [[I have almost forgotten what fear feels like; there was a time when I would have been terrified by the scream of someone in the night, and my hair would have stood on end; but now I have had so many horrors that even the most terrible thing can't scare me.]]

MACBETH: Wherefore was that cry? [[What was that scream for?]]

SEYTON: The queen, my lord, is dead. [[The Queen is dead, my lord.]]

MACBETH: She should have died hereafter; There would have been a time for such a word. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. [[She should have died later; there would have been a better time for that news. Day after day after day creeps slowly by until the end of time, and all our past days have been guiding fools toward death. Out, out, you short candle! Life is only a shadow that walks, a bad actor who worries and struts for a short time and then is never heard from again: it is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and anger, but means nothing.]]

MACBETH: Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. [[You came here to tell me something; tell it to me quickly.]]

MESSENGER: Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do it. [[Gracious my lord, I need to report what I saw, but I don't know how to say it.]]

MACBETH: Well, say, sir. [[Well, say it, sir.]]

MESSENGER: As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought, The wood began to move. [[As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought the wood began to move.]]

MACBETH: Liar and slave! [[Liar and slave!]]

MESSENGER: Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so: Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove. [[Let me feel your anger if it is not so; within three miles you can see it coming: a moving forest.]]

MACBETH: If thou speak'st false, Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much. I pull in resolution, and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out! If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. I gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish the estate o' the world were now undone. Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back. [[If you are lying, I'll hang you alive on the nearest tree until you starve; if you are telling the truth, I don't care if you do the same to me. I am losing my courage and beginning to doubt the lies of the devil, who speaks like he is telling the truth: "Don't be afraid until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane," and now a wood is coming toward Dunsinane. Arm yourselves, arm yourselves, and come outside! If what he says is true, then there is no escaping or staying here. I am getting tired of living, and I wish the world would end now. Ring the alarm bell! Blow, wind! Come, destruction! At least we'll die fighting.]]

MALCOLM: Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down. And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle, Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon 's what else remains to do, According to our order. [[We are close enough now; throw down your leafy shields and appear as you are. You, worthy uncle, will lead our first attack with my cousin, your noble son; worthy Macduff and I will do what else needs to be done, according to our battle plan.]]

SIWARD: Fare you well. Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night, Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight. [[Farewell. If we don't find the tyrant's army tonight, let us be beaten if we didn't at least try to fight.]]

MACDUFF: Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death. [[Make our trumpets blare; let them sound out as the harbingers of blood and death.]]

MACBETH: They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly, But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he That was not born of woman? Such a one Am I to fear, or none. [[They have tied me to a stake; I can't run away, but, like a bear, I have to fight until I die. Who is the one who was not born of a woman? I have to fear only that man, or no one.]]

YOUNG SIWARD: What is thy name? [[What is your name?]]

MACBETH: Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. [[You'll be afraid to hear it.]]

YOUNG SIWARD: No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell. [[No; even if you call yourself a name worse than any in hell.]]

MACBETH: My name's Macbeth. [[My name is Macbeth.]]

YOUNG SIWARD: The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear. [[The devil himself couldn't say a name that I hate more.]]

MACBETH: No, nor more fearful. [[No, nor one that causes more fear.]]

YOUNG SIWARD: Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword I'll prove the lie thou speak'st. [[You lie, you horrible tyrant; I will prove with my sword that you are lying.]]

MACBETH: Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born. [[You were born of a woman, but I smile at swords and laugh at weapons wielded by men born of women.]]

MACDUFF: That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine, My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still. I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune! And more I beg not. [[The noise is coming from that way. Tyrant, show your face! If you are killed and not by my sword, my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me forever. I can't fight these poor soldiers who are just being paid to carry spears; it has to be you, Macbeth, or else I will put my sword away having not used it. You have to be there; by the sound of the battle, someone important is here. Let me find him, fortune! I ask for nothing more.]]

SIWARD: This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd: The tyrant's people on both sides do fight; The noble thanes do bravely in the war; The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do. [[This way, my lord; the castle has been easily taken; the tyrant's soldiers are fighting on both sides; the noble thanes are fighting bravely in the war; it looks like you have won the battle, and there's little left to do.]]

MALCOLM: We have met with foes That strike beside us. [[We have met enemies who aren't really trying to hurt us.]]

SIWARD: Enter, sir, the castle. [[Enter the castle, sir.]]

MACBETH: Why should I play the Roman fool, and die On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes Do better upon them. [[Why should I commit suicide like a Roman soldier, when I can see living enemies, and I can better kill them?]]

MACDUFF: Turn, hell-hound, turn! [[Turn around, you fiend!]]

MACBETH: Of all men else I have avoided thee: But get thee back; my soul is too much charged With blood of thine already. [[I have tried to avoid you more than anyone else; but get back, because I have already killed too many of your family.]]

MACDUFF: I have no words: My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out! [[I don't have anything to say; my words are in my sword. You are too evil for words to describe!]]

MACBETH: Thou losest labour: As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed: Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield, To one of woman born. [[You are wasting your time; you are as likely to cut the air with your sword as to make me bleed. Put your blade on people who can be hurt; I have a charmed life and cannot be killed by anyone born of a woman.]]

MACDUFF: Despair thy charm; And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb Untimely ripp'd. [[Stop believing in your charm; and let the angel you have served tell you that Macduff was born by Caesarean section.]]

MACBETH: Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cow'd my better part of man! And be these juggling fiends no more believed, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee. [[Curse the person who tells me that, because it has taken away my courage! I will no longer believe those lying witches who trick us with double meanings, who give us promises that sound good but then turn out to be false. I won't fight you.]]

MACDUFF: Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o' the time: We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, 'Here may you see the tyrant.' [[Then surrender, you coward, and live to be a spectacle for everyone: we'll put you on display, like a rare monster, with a sign that says, "Here you can see the tyrant."]

MACBETH: I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, And to be baited with the rabble's curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff, And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!' [[I will not surrender, to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm and be cursed by the common people. Even though Birnam Wood has come to Dunsinane, and you are my enemy, and you weren't born of a woman, I will try to fight to the end. I will fight to the death. Come on, Macduff, and curse the one who cries first, "Stop!"]

MALCOLM: I would the friends we miss were safe arrived. [[I wish that our missing friends had returned safely.]]

SIWARD: Some must go off: and yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought. [[Some had to die, but judging by what I see, this great victory was worth the cost.]]

MALCOLM: Macduff is missing, and your noble son. [[Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.]]

ROSS: Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt: He only lived but till he was a man; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died. [[Your son, my lord, has died in battle: he lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he had proven his bravery in battle, he died like a man.]]

SIWARD: Then he is dead? [[Then he is dead?]]

ROSS: Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end. [[Yes, and he was taken off the battlefield. You shouldn't measure your sorrow by how great he was, because then you will never stop grieving.]]

SIWARD: Had he his hurts before? [[Did he have wounds on the front of his body?]]

ROSS: Ay, on the front. [[Yes, on the front.]]

SIWARD: Why then, God's soldier be he! Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death: And so, his knell is knoll'd. [[Then he is God's soldier! Even if I had as many sons as I have hairs, I couldn't wish for them to have a better death. So, his death has been announced.]]

MALCOLM: He's worth more sorrow, And that I'll spend for him. [[He was worth more than just that quick statement of grief, and I will grieve for him more.]]

SIWARD: He's worth no more They say he parted well, and paid his score: And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. [[He's worth no more than that. They say he died well and paid his debt to society; so, God be with him! Here comes better news.]]

MACDUFF: Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands The usurper's cursed head: the time is free: I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine: Hail, King of Scotland! [[Greetings, King! Because that is what you are; look, here is the tyrant's cursed head: we are free now. I see you surrounded by Scotland's nobles, who greet you in their minds; I want them to speak out loud with me: Hail, King of Scotland!]]

ALL: Hail, King of Scotland! [[Hail, King of Scotland!]]

MALCOLM: We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honour named. What's more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time, As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen, Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life; this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time and place: So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone. [[We will not wait long to show you our thanks and repay your loyalty. My thanes and relatives, from now on you will be earls, the first time that honor has been given in Scotland. We will also do other things, such as calling back our exiled friends who fled from Macbeth's watchful tyranny; bringing to justice the cruel servants of this dead butcher and his evil queen, who, it is believed, committed suicide; this, and whatever else is needed, we will do by the grace of God and at the right time and place. So, thank you all, and I invite you to see me crowned at Scone.]]
